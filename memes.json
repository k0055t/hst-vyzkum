Using their own estimates for distance the sun would be 4x farther away at sunrise/sunset than noon. Also the light would be 16x dimmer because light fades at a square root. Something they can test themselves with a flashlight. However the sun looks larger at sunrise/sunset. So simple observation contradicts their estimates so much it's obvious even without measurements. The only way to fix this is to have the sun way further out and way bigger. That way it looks nearly the same distance away at the horizon or directly above. However if the earth was flat you then all of the Earth is ether in daytime or night time. Something that is easy to prove is not the case."

The comments are overwhelmingly supportive and encouraging, suggesting that the community values individual freedom to explore and express unconventional ideas.\n\nHowever, there are also some subtle hints at authoritarian undertones in a few comments, such as \"_Alessandro's\" links to Flat Earth videos and \"vwirxp's\" comment about \"one man down / millions more to go\", which could be interpreted as a call for conformity or a criticism of those who don't conform.",
        "left_to_right_rating": "I would rate this post a 7.\n\nThe discussion revolves around someone who previously believed in Flat Earth theory and has now admitted they were wrong. The comments range from supportive (e.g., \"Glad to have him back on the side of sanity\") to dismissive (e.g., \"It takes a strong man to admit when they're wrong\"). Some users provide links to videos or try to offer explanations for why someone might change their mind, while others make jokes or sarcastic comments.\n\nThe tone of the post and most comments is neutral to slightly humorous, with no clear ideological leanings. However, some comments do reveal a left-leaning perspective (e.g., \"This essentially proves that flat-earthers are not idiots, but rather paranoid people who don\u2019t know who else to trust but themselves\"), while others have a more right-leaning or libertarian tone (e.g., \"The moment you Know there are ex-flat-earthers is the moment you Know earth is healing\"). The overall rating of 7 reflects a mix of both perspectives without a clear dominance."

You have families that could afford to have a nice house and short commute in a different suburb with shitty schools or a nasty 2 bedroom apartment with a predatory landlord in a district where every teacher has a master's degree and a good portion have their Ph.d.\n\nThey're going to see it as selfish behavior by the people who chose to put building equity over their kids' education and now want the benefits of both without voting to raise their own taxes to fund it."

The tone is playful and tongue-in-cheek, with no apparent advocacy for radical social change or extreme measures to maintain traditional values. The comments range from joking about knowing the results to making jokes about the impending doom of the world (in a humorous way). Overall, the post seems to be neutral in its politics, leaning slightly towards a light right perspective due to the focus on individual liberties and market forces implied by some of the comments."

Well now I gotta go to the store to buy candy to give to you. But all the stores are sold out because everyone loves candy.\n\nYou are very angry at me and demand I get you the candy back, no matter what the cost. So I pay lots of money for super expensive candy that nobody else buys.\n\nNow I'm very sad cause I have no candy and I have no money :(\n\nIm Melvin Capital, the candy is GameStop, and everyone buying candy is Reddit.\n\nCopy and paste it to spread the explanation!\n\n(Someone please make a bot that replies with this message, I'm tired of copy and pasting)"

If it's still 5 dollars that's fine i guess (but in the real world you pay interest and fees for this transaction so still not good).

Each time one of them finds some they pay a slightly higher price which drives up the price for all the others who then have to pay more.

The post itself is also about poking fun at online ads rather than promoting any kind of authoritarianism.

The post appears to be humorous and non-serious, with no apparent political agenda or ideological leaning. It's simply a meme about a silly situation, and the comments that follow are equally lighthearted and irreverent. There is no indication of support for radical social change, collective ownership, or strong government intervention (far left), nor does it advocate for individual liberties, lower taxes, or deregulation (light right). The tone is more akin to a playful joke or meme that might appeal to people across the political spectrum."

        "libertarian_to_authoritarian_rating": "-2 \n\nExplanation: \nThe post itself does not express any clear opinion or stance towards government involvement or individual freedom. It is simply a humorous reaction to news of COVID-19 cases in Finland, with some users making light-hearted jokes about the situation and others reacting more seriously.\n\nHowever, the comments reveal a range of opinions on the topic, from those who make fun of the situation (e.g., \"Finnish Man\") to those who are concerned or alarmed (e.g., \"Prepare for Florida Man's new sidekick Finnish Man\"). Some users seem to be poking fun at Finland's response to the pandemic, while others appear to be genuinely worried about the situation.\n\nOverall, based on the comments, I would say that the post leans slightly towards a libertarian position (-2) as it allows for a range of opinions and reactions to the news, including some that are critical or skeptical of government handling of the pandemic.",

The vast majority that had a combat deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan just sat around most of the time. Infantry of course is going to go out on patrol and stuff, but if you are anything else, even other direct combat positions like 11C or any of the artillery MOSs in the Army you basically just sat around at your base playing video games or being board as shit.\n\nThe ones not on combat deployments? Yea they just sat around playing video games or being bored as shit in Germany.\n\nThe vast majority of people in the US military are in non-combat roles because it takes a LOT of work to support those that are. It is like looking at the staff of a NFL team and going \"dang that is a lot of players!\" when most are actually coaches/trainers/assistants/etc there to support the players."

The comments that follow are mixed, with some people defending the military's recruitment efforts and others criticizing them. However, there is no overtly radical or extreme language used in the post or comments.\n\nThe tone of the post is more humorous and lighthearted than ideological, and it seems to be aimed at sparking a conversation rather than advocating for a specific political agenda."

For example if you live in a state that votes 60% blue and 40% red what would make sense is 60% of the vote to go blue and 40% red. However, if your state decides to change their rules to do that and the other states don't then you as a majority blue state are essentially just giving power over to red which is not in the interest of the majority of your voters so they are never going to agree to do that.\n\nChanging the system would only work if every state agrees to do it at once but that is a nightmare to try and get done because the current system gives extra power to small states who obviously don't want to give up said power. The system is broken but there really isn't a path forward to fix it with how entrenched many of our states are in voting for the same party every election."

He encouraged military support for Byzantine Emperor Alexios I against the Seljuk Turks and an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Across all social strata in western Europe there was an enthusiastic popular response. Volunteers took a public vow to join the crusade. Historians now debate the combination of their motivations, which included the prospect of mass ascension into Heaven at Jerusalem, satisfying feudal obligations, opportunities for renown, and economic and political advantage. Initial successes established four Crusader states in the Near East: the County of Edessa; the Principality of Antioch; the Kingdom of Jerusalem; and the County of Tripoli. The crusader presence remained in the region in some form until the city of Acre fell in 1291, leading to the rapid loss of all remaining territory in the Levant. After this, there were no further crusades to recover the Holy Land."

Of note, in \"Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack\" they even mention a slimmer Godzilla-like monster attacking New York during the movie, but all of the main characters immediately dismiss it and state it couldn't be Godzilla.\n\nThat being said, after the American copyright ran out for that IP the Japanese owners of the franchise brought the slimmer American Godzilla back as an enemy monster simply called \"Zilla\" for a few short scenes.\n\nThat's all my terrible memory and two minutes of Google searching can put together."

        "libertarian_to_authoritarian_rating": "6 \n\nThis post advocates for support for President Zelensky and the Ukrainian military, while also promoting national unity and resilience. It presents a strong sense of patriotism and solidarity with Ukraine. While it encourages donations to the military and spreading awareness about the situation in Ukraine, it does not advocate for individual freedoms or personal liberties as its primary focus. The post leans towards supporting government action and collective efforts to address external threats rather than emphasizing individual rights or limited government intervention.",
        "left_to_right_rating": "I would rate this post a 2. It appears to be slightly left-leaning due to its support for Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Ukraine's resistance against Russia, which could be seen as a progressive or liberal stance. However, the tone of the post is more focused on patriotism, leadership, and admiration for Zelenskyy rather than advocating for radical social change or promoting specific left-wing policies. The language used is also largely apolitical and centered around expressing solidarity with Ukraine."

A cow, for example, survives by eating grass all day, since they possess a simpler animal mindset. However, a human being wouldn't be able to use that method effectively, as the amount of time it would take to consume said grass exceeds the singular day it would power us for, so we eat the cow instead, as they've already farmed up all of that energy for us and stored it away in their meat.\n\nIn other words, assuming that an alien civilization with lightspeed capabilities or greater were to visit Earth, they'd likely need to consume a rather large amount of energy to keep *themselves* going, and by that logic, well... let's just say that the cow's probably not going to cut it for them."

The only thing where placebos really help is pain, because there how you perceive it is all that matters."

It could be positive or negative, and I ended up using it to notice myself getting stressed/angry when driving.\n\nThe *placebo* in this case is you brain feeling better when you think about pressing the button, without having to take a pill.

Fucking. Reeked.\n\nIt was so gross, that people were coming over to inspect what the commotion was. My mother, who worked at the school as a teacher, caught on to this pretty fast and had us throw it away (party pooper mum).\n\nLater that day, after the piss potion had been roasting in the outdoor bin under direct sunlight, the bin itself was almost impossible to see through the hundreds, if not thousands of flies that were swarming to that delicious sewerage bouquet.\n\nFun times."

Water + dirt = cloudy water.  Light clay + dirt = medium clay.  Fire + red meat = dark brown meat.  Fire + translucent fish = opaque fish.  Ochre colors can be mixed.

Works really well working with high functioning mentally ill and dangerous clients in group homes. They act out to try to get staff to react and I just stand there, pretty much ignoring. Nothing gives me more pleasure these days than a client getting overly verbally aggressive turning red in the face until they can't scream anymore and my only reaction at the end is \"are you done?\" And walk away. Pisses them off that I'm not scared by their posturing and using their diagnoses as an excuse to be an asshole."

Aye Jeffery you better watch your boi I'ma whoop him!\" \"ah shit man 65th birthday already I'm wishing you more years I ain't ready to see you go yet.\" \"Oh no  don't think like that, there is so much more to you then you could imagine, life ain't so bad and it gets better if only you could see what I see you'd find out you're special in your own way and deserve not only life but respect from both your colleagues and yourself, hang in there!\""

Having experience means they don't have to teach you the basics of the job, and the can spend fewer resources on training and correcting your mistakes. This is great for an entry level position. If you've already spent 3 years working for no or barely any pay at an internship, that means they can use that when determining how much they pay you. Even better if there's a large number of people looking for jobs, because then they can just hire whoever seems vaguely competent at what they need and who works for the lowest pay. Because at the end of the day, their concern is how much this is going to cost vs how much this is going to make them. Your ability (or need) to find a job doesn't factor into that equation."

        "left_to_right_rating": "Based on the content and tone of the post, I would rate it a 0. The post appears to be neutral and humorous, poking fun at the idea that formal education is always necessary for success. It doesn't express any strong opinions or ideologies, but rather presents a relatable situation and encourages discussion."

The comments also suggest that the community is poking fun at itself and acknowledging the imperfections of Reddit, but not advocating for any significant changes or government intervention.

The tone of the post is lighthearted and humorous, poking fun at the frustration of social media outages, rather than expressing any ideological or political views. The comments also range from neutral to slightly sarcastic, with some users making jokes about Facebook immigrants taking karma and others talking about their addiction to Reddit. None of the comments express any extreme left or right wing ideologies, but some users do mention their love for Reddit as a community, which could be interpreted as a form of online tribalism that is often associated with light right wing views."

        "left_to_right_rating": "Based on the content and tone of the post, I would rate it as: 4\n\nThe post appears to be a humorous meme about discovering that a sign is photoshopped or misleading, which suggests a lighthearted and non-political topic. The comments also focus on the absurdity of the situation and the humor in being \"tricked\" by the sign. There is no evident advocacy for radical social change, collective ownership, or strong government intervention, nor does it promote authoritarianism or nationalism. Overall, the tone is playful and apolitical, which aligns with a light right rating of 4."

The muzzle speed of a Glock 17 is 375 m/s, and a 9mm bullet weighs 7.0 to 8.3 grams (I'll use 8.3 to give the Glock as much recoil as possible). That means the momentum of the bullet will be 3.1125 kg m/s. Since momentum is conserved, all of that should transfer in the opposite direction to the gun, spacesuit, and astronaut. An average human has a mass of 62 kg (seems low to me, but a larger mass is going to reduce the speed further). As for the mass of a space suit, I've found a lot of conflicting answers so I'll use 127 kg which is what NASA says. So dividing the momentum by the combined mass of our astronaut and space suit gives us a speed of...\n\n0.0165 m/s, 0.0594 km/h, or 0.0369 mph. In other words, you're not going to die. You're going to barely move."

I don't think you would even need an added thruster, the rifling is going to absorb some projectile speed, so you should have plenty of momentum to impart in the gas, it is all about the amount you vent (or aiming it out of multiple ports at 88 degrees or so to waste some momentum)."

The only thing that's changed is it's orbital path. \nIf you wanted the bullet to leave orbit you would be better off shooting straight forwards from the ISS, since you already got the speed from the ISS going in that direction. You could still not make it leave orbit with any regular gun though since earth's escape velocity is 11.2km/s and the ISS moves at about 7.7 km/s, so you're bullet would have to leave the gun at 3.5km/s for it to leave orbit. And as far as I am aware that is about 8 times faster than bullets travel.\nThis is the same reason they push things they want to burn in the atmosphere backwards instead of downwards, pushing it downwards just changes the orbital path while pushing it backwards make it go towards earth."

Too much is a thing, but awkward silence is weird too. Just keep the convo light and don't give me your theories about the world and what pisses you off about the government. I don't care.\n\nOh, guys that deliver pizza 10 minutes early? Amazing.

Instead, the post seems to focus on the absurdity of rating systems in the gig economy and the humorous misunderstandings that can arise from them.\n\nHowever, some comments do express a slightly more collectivist tone, with users suggesting that drivers who are not talkative or courteous may still receive high ratings (e.g., \"unless your driver really fucks up\"). This implies a slight emphasis on social norms and expectations, which could be seen as leaning towards a lightly authoritarian perspective.\n\nOverall, the post's tone is playful and non-confrontational, making it more in line with a libertarian or neutral stance.",

There is no clear indication of any radical social change advocated for, nor is there a strong emphasis on collective ownership, wealth redistribution, or government intervention.

The overall tone is critical of Blizzard's decision to ban a player for speaking out in support of Hong Kong democracy, implying that the company has compromised its values for financial gain. This aligns more closely with libertarian sentiments, which emphasize personal freedom and limited government interference.",

The tone is not extremely radical or far-left, but rather a mix of humor, satire, and advocacy for human rights, which aligns with light left-wing perspectives."

On the other  hand, you can have 0 formal training and a godlike portfolio, and companies will give you contracts halfway across the world.\n\n***Fine art*** seems to be a social game where being in style or having an audience is more important than basically anything else. You don't really have to be mechanically good at anything to make a statement or catch eyes but it does help. There are artists out there who do high school level art making money because they've acquired a massive following, and there's nothing wrong with that. The artist is happy, the customer is happy, no one is getting hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, at least for commercial artists, if you aren't training with the same dedication and mindset that an athlete does, you aren't going anywhere."

On twitch once you get associate you can play ads on you\u2019re streams to bring in some extra money and each tier 1 sub costs about 6 USD it\u2019s safe to bet that if they have upward of 100 subs and 1k followers they make relatively decent money \n\n2) are people going to donate bits or money? i\u2019ve seen varying results with the whole donation part of it, some streamers get quite a lot from those donations like Callmecarson Ph1lza and Pokimain make *a lot* in donations through just one stream, however when you step away from the big channels and move to something smaller donations vary from streamer. i\u2019ve seen streams where hardly a single dollar was given but also where over 1k was given. \n\nthese are just what i\u2019ve noticed as an advent twitch streams watcher and have had similar conversations with people who run smaller twitch channels"

Have you ever had a chipmunk scurry down your naked body at 3 am?  \n\nAt least she only killed them if she was going to eat them.  She only brought me live and generally uninjured but really pissed off critters.   Ever had a pissed off flying squirrel in your bed?"

DNA is two separate strands that are wound in a double helix, but a major component of DNA are nitrogenous bases (aka the C, T, G, and A). G is complementary to C and A is complementary to T, so in fact every 3.4 Angstroms (0.34nm) the DNA strands are touching and holding on to one another tightly.\n\nFor the sake of the metaphor, I think DNA is a beautiful example of what true love could be. Separate entities, that are perfectly complementary, and when one is damaged the other can be used as a template to repair the damage.\n\nSource: Am graduate student in molecular biology/cancer biology.

The comments are mostly playful and non-confrontational, with some users making jokes or sharing personal stories. There is no apparent attempt to impose a particular ideology or promote a specific agenda, which suggests that the post falls on the libertarian side of the spectrum. However, the tone is not extreme, and there is no advocacy for radical individualism or rejection of all government involvement.",

However, there is no apparent radical social change advocacy or strong government intervention views expressed; it's all relatively innocuous commentary on the topic."

That guy put on quite the deadly glare when I did, and others looked simply amazed.  Anyway the teacher (no doubt expecting I had made a mistake) asked me (shy person) to write the solution on the board for everyone to see.  Yes, that is quite correct the embarrassed (no doubt sexist) teacher said and I sat down.  He obviously expected I had made some mistake.  No one said a word.  I never did that again in case there was another performance required though, and the guy would often glance over at me to see if I had beaten him after lol."

Well now I gotta go to the store to buy candy to give to you. But all the stores are sold out because everyone loves candy.\n\nYou are very angry at me and demand I get you the candy back, no matter what the cost. So I pay lots of money for super expensive candy that nobody else buys.\n\nNow I'm very sad cause I have no candy and I have no money :(\n\nIm Melvin Capital, the candy is GameStop, and everyone buying candy is Reddit.\n\nCopy and paste it to spread the explanation!\n\n(Someone please make a bot that replies with this message, I'm tired of copy and pasting)"

As far as I know, the potato account was never doxed.

This is why even in Thursday with a coordinated effort to shut town retail trading and price fixing by some brokers reselling the same shares back and forth at loss where 20% was covered the prices didn't significantly drop and now due to the public eye they don't have that option for criminal assistance again and will likely pay to the SEC for having done it (though that comparatively will cost nothing).\n\nEven if they somehow at 0-sum eliminated this debt right now then we accomplished wiping out 70% of a predatory hedge funds assets and potentially saved future jobs from these market manipulators. I'm proud of that."
