And for what? So that some country, whose name most of them can't pronounce, which did not even exist 20 years prior to that, can maybe hold onto a territory whose population clearly wishes to be a part of Germany.\n\nBut most of us never think about any of that. Instead, we partake in this textbook example of hindsight bias, that the acquisition of Sudetenland only delayed the inevitable and emboldened Hitler for more expansion. Which ignores the simple fact, that Britain only ended up at war with Gemrany because they chose, because they declared war after the invasion of Poland. If they wanted to, they could have stayed out of the war indefinitely, since Germns did not have the capacity, nor the aspiration, to invade the isles."

Russia gets a piece of Poland, because they have nukes.\n\nIf Russia isn't stopped now, they will keep invading neighbouring countries, until every bit of land that was ever colonised by Russia is theirs again. And then some, because if we'd try to prevent this, they'd use nukes. \n\nRussia also famously doesn't keep its word. Remember the Budapest memorandum? Ukraine gave up the Soviet nukes stored on its territory in exchange for Russia, the US and the UK guaranteeing Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty. Russia broke that promise in 2014 and is still breaking it now. \n\nAny agreement that gives Russia the currently occupied parts of Ukraine in exchange for peace will eventually get broken, too. \n\nThe Russian people might be in favour of expanding their borders, but as recent events have shown, they're not willing to personally die for this endeavour. When nukes fly, they fly in both directions."

This is basic mate, if Tesla is having trouble finding workers they'll just keep paying more till they find the workers.\n\nNobody is forced to work in any company. If people want to work hard and earn more that's their right - who TF do you think you are telling workers they can't sleep in their factory till 3am if they want to?\n\nIf people don't want to get a job at Tesla or want to work elsewhere they're all free to do so.\n\nElon is just far, far smarter than you sorry."

By seizing Ukraine, Russia will get a new economic resource to threaten Europe, and a buffer in Europe of thousands of kilometers in the event of a war with NATO, which they are obviously heading towards, similarly to how Hitler headed to war by invading Czechoslovakia in 1938.

Followed by a wonderful takedown. I wonder if this Ukrainian guy has training?\n\n\nI bet we all wish he could have beat the shit out of this loser once he was on the ground, but then he could get punished for it, because the law would see that as excessive...

The author appears to be supporting government intervention (in the form of police involvement) and criticizing those who didn't intervene earlier. This suggests a lightly authoritarian stance, as they seem to value order and stability over individual freedoms in certain situations.",
        "left_to_right_rating": "6 \n\nThe post appears to be discussing an incident involving a pregnant woman being attacked by someone at a bus stop, and how an Ukrainian man intervened to protect her. The comments are generally supportive of the Ukrainian man's actions and critical of the attacker.\n\nSome comments use strong language and make derogatory remarks about the attacker, but overall the tone is one of outrage against the attack and praise for the Ukrainian man's bravery.\n\nThe topic doesn't seem to be explicitly political, but some comments do touch on issues like nationalism and immigration. However, these are not the main focus of the discussion.\n\nGiven this context, I would rate the post a 6, which falls into the \"light right\" category. The tone is generally one of support for individual liberties and self-defense, rather than advocating for radical social change or authoritarianism."

Ironically, current Russian propaganda stands on machismo and distancing from \"western multiculturalism and sexual degeneracy\", Russia as a state is interconnected with its oligarchs, Nazbol ideas of having control over entire Eurasia is also a thing there.

However, the comments range from criticism of Russia's actions to mocking its propaganda efforts, indicating a generally anti-authoritarian sentiment among the commenters. Some users make light-hearted jokes about Russian aggression, while others express frustration with the country's actions and the way it presents itself to the world. Overall, the tone is more irreverent than aggressive, leaning towards libertarianism due to its critique of government control and propaganda efforts.",

The tone is sarcastic and mocking, with several commenters making humorous remarks about Russia's history of aggression. While there are a few comments that attempt to justify or downplay Russia's actions, the majority of the discussion appears to be firmly on the side of criticizing Russia's behavior. Overall, the post seems to reflect a moderate left-wing perspective, with a focus on skepticism towards authoritarian regimes and a desire for transparency and accountability."

Muslimove maji dva zasadni problemy: naprostou neochotu se prizpusobit spolecenskym pravidlum a chovani v zapadni zemi, ktera vicemene pochazi z pohrdani vsech jejichz buh neni Allah, proste sem nakroci a hned od zacatku jsme pro ne podlidi a my se musime prizpusobovat jim. A pak je to vyssi procento kriminalniku, protoze ze svych chudsich zemi jsou proste nauceni krast, protoze klasicky kapitalisticky model pracujes-dostanes penize-koupis si co potrebujes u nich moc nefunguje, penize a moc tam maji ty nejvetsi hyeny.\n\nPak z toho vznikaji ty pruvody desetitisicu muslimu, kteri maji transparenty a nahlas krici ze tato zeme je ted jejich, stane se muslimskou a evropane se bud musi prizpusobit nebo odejit. Doslova jsou hrdi na to ze zabiraji cizi uzemi. A treba ve Svedsku, kde bylo puvodne skoro 10 milionu obyvatel, a nabrali si tam pres milion a pul muslimu (ted jsem nekde slysel ze uz tam jsou 3 miliony muslimu ale to se mi nechce verit), ted muslimove zakladaji politicke strany, a jelikoz to jsou \"vzorni\" volici narozdil od Svedu, tak uz muslimove zacinaji prolezat do zastupitelstev a dokonce pomalu i do vlady, a s tim jak se exponencialne mnozi by mohli ovladnout parlament do roku 2050, coz by jim dalo pravo kompletne menit zakony na promuslimske - povoleni 5x denne se modlit v praci nebo kdekoli jinde, zakaz pojidani prasat, koran a arabske pismo a jazyk ve skolach, a pak to prejde na zakaz homosexuality, legalni mnohozenstvi, zavedeni muslimskych svatku a tradic, az se Svedsko kompletne transformuje na novou Syrii.\n\nSyrani a obecne arabove nejsou \"spatni\" lide, s mnoha z nich jsem se kamaradil, pracoval a spolecne bydlel kdyz jsem studoval a pracoval v zahranici. Jako jednotlivci jsou uplne ok zpravidla. Ale jako velka skupina nebo spolecnost uz se chovaji mnohem radikalneji, protoze zpravidla maji par silnych rafikalnich vudcu, ktere nasleduji. A hlavne sve nabozenstvi neberou jako vicemene soukromou vec, jako my evropane kteri nikde neventilujeme ani nevnucujeme ostatnim, oni naopak davaji jasne najevo ze jejich nabozenstvi je to jedine spravne a pripustne a kdo to nerespektuje je nepritel a zradce.\n\nJo a zapomnel jsem zminit ze mladi muslimove nesmi pit alkohol a mit sex pred svatbou, takze hlavne mladi muzi jsou extremne frustrovani a kdyz se dostanou do evropy kde holky nosi bikiny, minisukne, hluboke vystrihy a maji nulovou obranu nebo prevenci proti uchylakum, tak samozrejme mladi muslimove vyuziji situace a obtezuji zeny na koupalistich, osahavaji je v nacpane mhd, a v krajnich pripadech i skupinove znasilnuji.\n\nPolitici si muzou rikat co chteji, ale muslimove proste nejsou integrovatelni, oni se nechcou prizpusobovat a svoje zvyky a nabozenstvi si praktikovat jen tise v soukromi. Je to porad ta horka krev co se v minulych tisiciletich snazila dobyt a transformovat evropu. A my jim ted tu invazi umoznujeme bez odporu."

Nejhorsi jsou zeme co s eu nemaji v podstate nic spolecneho, neobchoduji, neni tam turismus  a maji stale tvrdsi muslimske zakony, jako mnohozenstvi, omezena nebo nulova prava zen, telesne tresty, nefunkcni ekonomiku a v nejhorsim pripade valku - to jsou zeme jako syrie, afganistan, iran, jemen a vicemene i irak a pakistan. Odtud jezdi uprchlici kteri jsou casto negramotni (podle wiki se zakladni gramotnost muze pohybovat i pod 50%), a jsou zvykli shanet obzivu ilegalne a casto i nasilne. \n\nV nasi ekonomice kde musis mit aspon zakladni vzdelani, znat statni jazyk nebo aspon anglictinu, chodit do prace od 8 do 5 a dodrzovat cely svazek knih zakonu a etiket slusneho chovani (ktere jsou pro nas z velke casti automaticke, chapeme hranice slusneho chovani, co se smi a co je neslusne, oni ale takove navyky nemaji) jsou v podstate na urovni 6-12-ti letych deti, a EU predpoklada ze se zaintegruji a budou v podstate nova pracovni sila skoro \"zadarmo\". No nekteri mozna ano, ale fakt nevim jak moc se budou hrnout do nekvalifikovanych pracovnich pozic.\n\n\nUplne nejvetsi pruser jsou zeme kde se ve velkem obchoduje s drogami. Tam ta ekonomika nefunguje v podstate vubec, lidi jsou tam 24/7 zfetovani a obzivu maji z prodeje drog. Ted si nepamatuju ktera to je zeme, ale videl jsem video kde v podstate cela vnitrni ekonomika byla o prodeji nejake lokalni drogy, a zeme samotna mela mensi prijmy z vnejsku jen za prodej nerostnych surovin. Obyvatele ale jinak produkovali nulovy export krome te tezby a vyvozu, jinak to byli bud farmari co obstaravali jidlo, nebo obchodovali s drogami. Nic vic. Mam dojem ze to je Jemen ale jisty si nejsem. Odtud mit uprchliky by byla katastrofa.\n\nEdit: Jo je to Jemen, maji tam lokalni drogu zvanou Qat nebo khat, coz je rostlina ktera se zvyka, a ma stimulacni euforicke ucinky jak kokain. Zaroven ale dela z cloveka tupou zeleninu a mj. extremne kazi zuby, lide so ji zvykaji v podstate nemaji zadne zuby."

The only cultural difference is that they do it directly to a stranger, while local people do it secretely to the people they know behind closed doors. But considering the prevalence of these crimes in our country, to me it seems unfair to use a concern about the safety of our women and children as an argument against immigrants while not realizing that immigrants probably wouldn't enhance this problem much as it is already happening on a large scale by our citizens."

Punishment death for leaving that religion.\n\nWomen who cheat? Punishment by death. Men somehow can cheat.\n\nWhen a man is convicted of raping a woman he will be redeemed if he marries her. Yeah nothing says European values than forcefully marrying your rapist.\n\nYou criticize Muhammad or don't believe in him being a prophet? Punishable by death.\n\nCriticize or disbelieve in Allah? Death.\n\nThe only reason why Christianity is bearable now is cause Christians are taking away less and less from their religion.\n\nhttps://layman.org/survey-shows-majority-of-muslims-in-favor-of-sharia/\n\n\"While there is a strong backing for Sharia to be the official law of the land (nearly 60 percent of those surveyed), there is a variance by country. For example, fewer than one in 10 Muslims subscribe to Sharia as the official law in Azerbaijan and just 12 percent of Turkish Muslims agree. However, that is in stark contrast to the 99 percent of those surveyed in Afghanistan who are in support of Sharia and 74 percent of Muslims in Egypt.\n\nSupport for making Sharia the official law of the land is higher in countries like Pakistan (84 percent) and Morocco (83 percent) where the constitution or basic laws favor Islam over other religions. The study also showed that countries with Muslims praying several times a day are more likely to support Sharia as an official law than those where Muslims pray less frequently.\"\n\nAnd they also are in favour of religious leaders having influence over political matters. Which goes directly against our values. Especially in Czechia where we don't like religions. ALL religions. Christianity is stupid, Islam is stupid etc... The only good religious people are the ones that you don't even know they are religious.\n\nWe can say that majority of them is definitely not compatible with us. But hey, they have more than enough islamic countries to go to. Why don't they go to their fellow Islamic countries?"

However, that is in stark contrast to the 99 percent of those surveyed in Afghanistan who are in support of Sharia and 74 percent of Muslims in Egypt.\n\nWhich was my point the entire time. \u201eMuslim\u201c is an incredibly diverse label. 12% of Turks is still a massive amount and way too much but it\u2019s not most. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say. \n\n>Support for making Sharia the official law of the land is higher in countries like Pakistan (84 percent) and Morocco (83 percent) where the constitution or basic laws favor Islam over other religions. The study also showed that countries with Muslims praying several times a day are more likely to support Sharia as an official law than those where Muslims pray less frequently.\"\n\nWell no shit. People in countries where sharia is (partly) in effect are in favour of it. And especially that Afghanistan number I\u2019d take with a huge grain of salt as I definitely know how I would\u2019ve answered in an extremist country. \n\n>We can say that **majority** of them is definitely not compatible with us.\n\nThat\u2019s what I disagree with."

Communists have rotten the society from inside, lying, denoucing became the norm and then wild capitalism in the 90s made sure traditional structures like family were partialy dismantled. \n\nLife of some people became so meaningless, notions of honor, truth, beauty, courage, honest work became a distant relic of the 1st Republic (or even Habsbourgs) that the best part of their mundane day spent consuming either food, beer or TV is jerking off to porn - and hence thier pride on this sub.\n\nBut idk, just an idea"

Once when they were getting ready to play a game of soccer, some kids came to take over the field.  One of their biggest players (probably a head taller than my dad) challenged my dad to fight for it.  So as he was taking of his shirt my dad just pushed him of the field down a hillside, where the guy somersaulted and rolled through shrubbery. It could have been a serious injury but he slowly climbed up all scratched up and then left the field for my dads gang.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA second time while lining up to go see a movie, one of the older bullies on the street was working the line - shaking down the other kids for money or their ticket.  As he got to my dad, before he could say anything he got punch in the eye and moments later my dad was inside watching the film.  The other guy would not have been able to see much of it anyway given his black eye.  \n\nThe funny thing is that after those two incidents my dad got a reputation and the bullies stayed away even though he didn't think he was that tough."

The Czech architects who left their mark are, among others, Karlo Par\u017eik, Franc Bla\u017eek, Jan Kotjera\u2026\n\n Among the buildings built by Czech architects were residential buildings, public buildings, villas, a sacral building and more.  These are, for example, the National Theater, the Ashkenazi Temple, the first project of the City Hall, the Sharia Judicial School (Faculty of Islamic Sciences).\n As Krzovi\u0107 says, these are still striking objects.\""

The discussion revolves around the supposed fact that both buildings were designed by Czechs, which is later revealed to be incorrect, but this doesn't seem to have any deeper implications on the posters' views on government control or individual freedom.",

British and American English are both \"correct\" in their respective environments. The Czech you're learning right now is the only formally correct way to speak Czech, but the language we use in informal situations is a bit different.\n\nI wouldn't worry about it though. Focus on the \"correct\" way your teacher is teaching you, that will give you a good foundation and you'll be able to communicate without problems (everyone will understand you). You'll also be able to read almost everything because with a couple of exceptions (some forum posts and private communication etc.), almost everything is written in the formal language. The informal language is something you pick up naturally if you live among Czechs for some time."

More than half of the class was failiing, there was extra schooling held and no matter how much she tried, we just couldn't get it down. True enough, she didn't try that hard. Her explanation was always the same: start with A, continue with B, then D happens, but wait, B also does this and completes A with this, and then C is in there somewhere, so B and the C and sometimes D but never E, except sometimes E,....  Can you see why half of the class was failing the subject? Her favourite teaching method was showing us PowerPoint slides made by her colleague a few years ago. Zero effort. I hated her stupid guts. You know how I passed my exam? Thanks to a damn 3-minute-long youtube video! Three minutes on youtube taught me more than this joke of a teacher for 3 damn months.\n\nSchooling is a damn joke in Czech Republic. I'm not saying the system somewhere else is better, I have no idea how they do schooling in Norway, Greece or Taiwan, but I definitely think it has a lot to improve. IMHO your educational system is succesfull if it produces students who are eager and willing to learn, not burnt out husks who get intimidated by a long body of text with no pictures."

So in theory you got 100 people each year who graduate as teachers, but 95% of them do NOT want to teach, but seeing as they have no real options on the matter, they gotta go and do the only job they're qualified to do.\n\nEither way, this is not how it should be. You shouldn't be marked for your behaviour, looks or opinions. Teacher being mean to students shouldn't even exist. Students who are bored at school shouldn't exist. There is a way to make it all interesting, easy to learn and achievable, but the whole educational system in this country is absolutely counter-productive.\n\nOr maybe not.

In Czech Republic, we are taught about him all the time and yet, I haven't found a lot of teachers that follow the \"\u0160kola hrou\" saying until just recently once I started to study graphic design, which is probably because the kind of people that go to such schools are likeminded and laid-back. I actually like going to school now, or at least don't hate it. It's just mindblowing how they force us to go there for the better part of our childhood and expect us to like learning when we get constantly yelled at for not being able to, because the teachers cannot have different approaches according to each student at the same time. The teacher just chooses an approach and then the students have to bend themselves to it, which results in horrible grades because everybody learns differently. \n\nWe have to sit in one place for hours at a time with limited movement, limited freedom to be creative (even subjects intended to do creative things are very limited. I hate the arts and crafts subject and I'm an artist. The teacher decides what I draw and how I draw it. That's not fun at all!), limited freedom to do absolutely anything. It's infuriating. The whole world should change the way they teach children imo."

There is no clear advocacy for government control or regulation, nor is there an emphasis on individual freedom or liberty. The tone is lighthearted and satirical, which suggests a rating of 5 (lightly libertarian) as it does not take a strong stance either way.",
        "left_to_right_rating": "6 \n\nThe post appears to be light right leaning, as it contains some references to libertarian and anti-government sentiments (e.g., \"bud policajti v ostatnich statech jsou liny mrchy... nebo tu m\u00e1me probl\u00e9mek\"), but overall it's more focused on humor and memes rather than extreme ideological positions. The comments are also varied in their tone and content, ranging from jokes about Walter White to discussions of methamphetamine use and government spending, which makes it difficult to pinpoint a clear left or right leaning."

Some comments also contain sarcastic or humorous remarks about the value of voting, which suggests a certain level of apathy or cynicism towards the political system. However, none of the comments exhibit overtly radical or extremist views, nor do they advocate for extreme measures to maintain traditional values or social order. Overall, the tone is more resigned and skeptical than actively ideological, placing it in the center-right to light right range."

Poland is already a part of the EU and the Visegrad Four, but they have the weird political situation going on, so I guess we are already as close as the situation allows. And there is already a lot of Ukranians here and the Czech Republic is trying to protect them from traffickers and make them feel more welcome by cancelling the need for work visa for them. I can only hope that this trend continues, but I have no concrete ideas."

We also have problems with Czech language, but if you speak slowly I can understand you and you will understand me, because in such situation I will be talking slowly, often using different words/ways to express the same thing to allow you to understand better. This way it works. If one is speaking fast, no chance to understand. Our languages are both West Slavic, so it works, you are right, Russian being East Slavic is much more difficult for us both."

Poland however also produces high quality meat. There were isolated cases of contaminated products, and shady manufacturers. Those sort of events happen everywhere in the world (cases of salmonella in lettuce in Germany that killed a number of people spring to my mind).

The comments also seem to be focused on sharing personal anecdotes or jokes related to similar situations, with some users jokingly identifying with the sentiment of being \"stuck\" in certain places. However, a few users do express more serious sentiments about their experiences with bureaucracy and government regulations, which could potentially lean towards authoritarian themes. Overall, though, the tone is playful rather than ideological, and I would rate it as leaning slightly toward libertarianism due to its focus on individual freedom and poking fun at restrictive situations.",

The original image posted by ChaoticNeutralCzech is humorous and lighthearted, poking fun at being stuck in an unfamiliar situation. The comments that follow are also mostly lighthearted and humorous, with some users sharing their own experiences of being stuck or frustrated with bureaucratic systems. There is no clear indication of any ideological leaning or agenda in the post or comments, and they do not appear to be promoting any specific political viewpoint."

Its all a blur now..) one of the first countries to be vaccinated as a result and open back to normal. Putin is hoping the previous soviet states rejoin once the EU breaks up (Putin hopes, due to in-fighting over gas and the economy and sanctions etc).\n\nWe have to stay United EU family, don\u2019t let Putin break us up \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa\ud83d\udc99\n\nEdit: just saw South Korea also!!\nI guess this symbolises that it is North Korea, China and Russia against the Western and democratic world."

Lately though, Czech microbreweries are starting to get in on the experimental flavors game, and it\u2019s produced some fine stuff, as well. Had a few great pumpkin beers here, and one really exceptional beer brewed with coconut (a travesty, I know, but a tasty one)."

The tone of the comments also suggests that some users are advocating for a level of control or regulation, albeit in a lighthearted manner, over what can be expressed on social media. However, this does not necessarily translate to a strong desire for government control over all aspects of life, which is why I would rate it as lightly authoritarian rather than very authoritarian.",

The tone of the comments ranges from playful and humorous (e.g., \"Vy\u0161ehradsk\u00e1 4 a Baltick\u00e1 4\") to satirical and critical (e.g., \"Annexation is only the first part of the plan\"). Some comments also express confusion or skepticism about the nature of the post. Overall, the tone leans towards libertarianism, as it pokes fun at the idea of government control and annexation, but without advocating for any specific political ideology.",
        "left_to_right_rating": "5\n\nThe post's title and comments suggest a lighthearted, humorous tone, with some users expressing excitement or confusion about the Czech Republic being referred to as a Baltic state. While some comments mention annexation and geopolitics, they appear to be in jest rather than serious advocacy for radical social change or authoritarianism. The overall atmosphere is playful and tongue-in-cheek, indicating a moderate political leaning."

There's no clear argument for or against individual freedom or government involvement, making it lightly libertarian in nature.",

Nowadays you could probably still see it in villages where people know each other by name and there is no real police presence. In the big city, government busybodies will set up sting operations where they send a minor (often nerdy innocent looking teenage girls to maximize the odds of success) with a \"note from the parents\" telling the clerk to sell them alcohol because they are \"buying on behalf of their parents\" and if the clerk gives in, the cops arrest him. It's one of the more hypocritical aspects of our society. Everybody knows that 15 year olds drink, everybody knows that back when they were 15, they drank, everybody knows that nothing happened to them and that nothing will happen to the current generation of 15 year olds either, but the people making the decisions just act like they don't know this and that if a high-schooler gets a beer, he will drop dead on the spot."

I personally love going to hospoda with my friends, but we don't go there primarily to get *drunk* - and I honestly think most (mature) people don't either. You get drunk once in a while, sure, but mostly we go there to have a couple beers and *talk*, catch up, have a good time together. There are many activities that can be done with friends, but personally, there's very little I want to do more with friends I haven't seen in a while than sit down in a nice space, maybe have something good to eat and drink, and just chat. The couple beers will help put you in a good mood, loosen up and relax, unwind after a long day; and of course, they're also just enjoyable. But mostly, I'm there for the friendly bonding and banter.\n\nI would agree that it is kinda pathetic imo to get blackout drunk every single time you go to a pub if that's the case, or to get that drunk every time you drink. I think that it's mostly teenagers who do that tho. It's a phase most of them'll grow out of. At least that's been my experience so far (which obviously doesn't speak for the majority of the population).\n\nBut yeah, I think there's a misconception there that drinking = getting drunk. From the American people I've talked to (which is not that many), it seems that that's indeed the case most of the time, that's what happens at bars and stuff, you drink to get drunk. People go there and get shitfaced. But it's absolutely not like that here, not as a rule."

You have literally thousands of options but you choose to do one thing every single time).\n\nii) Catching up is great but I feel like many Czechs do this 'catching up' 2-3 times a week with a pretty constant group. At that point it's not catching up anymore but more of your typical bored middle aged dudes sitting, drinking beer and complaining about politics and football. Catching up requires you having actually experienced something new in the meantime. Essentially the same situation that happens several times a week for 40 years of their life."

The tone of the post seems to be somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but it also appears to be making a commentary on the human condition that could be interpreted as slightly pessimistic or cynical.",

In general concurrence with peer-reviewed scientific literature, he states this to be \"the current understanding of the minimum amount of time necessary to obviate male hormone gender related advantages in sports competition\". Vilain reviewed Fox's medical records and said she has \"clearly fulfilled all conditions.\" When asked if Fox could, nonetheless, be stronger than her competitors, Vilain replied that it was possible, but noted that \"sports is made up of competitors who, by definition, have advantages for all kinds of genetics reasons\"."

The majority of comments express concerns and criticisms about the influx of Ukrainian refugees and their potential impact on the economy, jobs, and societal welfare. Some comments even resort to xenophobic and nationalist rhetoric. While there are a few voices advocating for understanding and compassion, the overall tone is one of resistance to change and a desire for government control over immigration policies. This suggests a leaning towards authoritarianism, as it prioritizes order and stability over individual freedoms and personal choices.",

The only consistent parties are Communist party (that angered their voters by supporting a billionaire's political party called ANO) and some mostly minor parties that often only really care about one aspect like Zelen\u00ed (Greens, supposed to be environmentally minded party) or Monarchists (they want to change the political system to constitutional monarchy and make the country a kingdom, but even though they have intelligent members, the party doesn't really offer anything else as if they thought the King would solve everything else) or other mostly obscure parties that rarely get more than few hundreds or thousands of votes."

The image and comments suggest a sense of humor and irony, but also a clear anti-communist sentiment. The majority of comments seem to be from people who are happy about the decline of communism in the Czech Republic, with some even jokingly referring to themselves as \"tankies\" (a term often used in online communities to mock communist or socialist ideologies). Overall, the tone is more playful than aggressive, but still leans towards a right-leaning or centrist perspective."

Then form into loaves, boil in salt water, then let rest again a bit to have it steam out and cut. \n\nFor the stew well I used gulash meat, bell pepper, beer (instead of red wine), pearl onions, garlic,  tomato paste, flour, beef broth, then bayleaf, paprika, salt/pepper, thyme and a bit of rosemary.\n\nBasically cut meat into little cubes. Sprinkle in a bowl with flour, s&p and paprika powder. Fry in a bit of butter in high heat until there is a nice crust on every side. Use a big iron cast pot with a lid.\n\nRemove meat, now simply fry bell pepper, onions and garlic (don't bother chopping the latter two and leave the bell pepper only quartered). They will disintegrate into the stew anyways. \n\nAfter everything is just slightly browned, readd meat, then add flour and butter, then tomato paste and bayleaves. Fry a bit, then deglaze with beer and scrub the yummy bottom of the pot (if you did it correctly it won't be burned) and let it boil. Then add the other spices to taste and a lot of broth. Bring to a boil.\n\nPut the entire pot into a preheated oven at around 160-180C. Open the lid just a tiny bit so steam can come out.\n\nThat's basically it. Maybe stirr every other hour to check, but now leave this baby going from 4-8 hours or so until tender."

The trick for this is using the same amount of onion and meat weight wise. Brown that onion till it's caramelised. If you do this, you don't have to use flour to thicken it and it will prevent the gulash from going sour fast, so you can let it sit for few days for the tastes to develop.\n\nBe careful with the paprika. It shouldn't sit on high heat longer than minute because it goes bitter really fast. So don't try and brown the meat with the paprika, just do the meat by itself, then do the onions, then throw in the spice and garlic, then when it's getting fragrant dump liquid of your choice."

The post and many comments seem to be poking fun at the stereotype of older Czechs being overly critical and dismissive, but in doing so, they also touch on themes of social control and regulation, such as \"zav\u0159\u00edt v\u0161echny\" (close all) and lockdowns. Some comments even suggest that this kind of attitude is justified or necessary for maintaining order. This suggests a leaning towards authoritarianism, but it's still a lighthearted and humorous take rather than a serious advocacy for strict control.",
        "left_to_right_rating": "6\n\nThe post appears to be satirical and pokes fun at the stereotype of older Czechs being overly critical and dismissive. The comments also reflect a mix of sarcastic and humorous responses, with some users making light of the situation or expressing frustration with the current state of affairs in Czech politics. Overall, the tone is more playful than overtly political, but there are hints of disillusionment and cynicism among some commenters."

However, others defend the communist period and argue that the post is too simplistic or inaccurate in its portrayal of history. The overall tone is more conversational and anecdotal than ideological, which makes it difficult to categorize as strongly authoritarian or libertarian.",

However, most of the comments seem to lean towards a nostalgic or critical view of communism and the early Czechoslovakian republic, with some users expressing dissatisfaction with the current state of their country's economy.)"
