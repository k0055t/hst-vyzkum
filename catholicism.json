Jesus renamed him and told him that he would be the rock (in Greek Petros which became his new English name, Peter) that Jesus would build his church upon. \n\nPart of being that rock was being given the figurative \"keys to the kingdom\". Jesus told Peter whatever he bonds on Earth will be bound in heaven and whatever he looses on Earth will be loosed in heaven. This was the source of the Peter, the first Pope's, authority in the Church. Since then the keys of heaven have been apart of the papal insignia and because the Vatican city is ruled by the Pope the flag of the Vatican has the Pope's insignia in the design.\n\n\nSide note, the concept of a king (Jesus) giving their steward (Peter) the keys to the kingdom and the ability to enact their laws is a further reference to the relationship between Jewish kings and their stewards in the old testament. This would have been obvious to the original Jewish audience but many things become lost in translation through the milennia."

However, the mention of donating $1 from each mask sold to offer mass at a local Newman Center could be seen as promoting a level of communal involvement in religious activities, which might lean slightly towards authoritarianism in its emphasis on collective action and shared values.",
        "left_to_right_rating": "6 \n\nThe post appears to be light right leaning as it promotes entrepreneurship and free market capitalism by selling handmade masks, with no apparent advocacy for radical social change or collective ownership. The language used is also friendly and encouraging, which is often associated with conservative or libertarian ideologies. However, there's no explicit mention of conservative or far-right views, so a moderate score of 6 seems fitting."

Stuff happens spontaneously, and Jesus knows your heart. \n\nScrupulosity (I may have spelled that wrong) is its own problem. People need to examine themselves before they nitpick at others---I don't think Jesus would've made some of the comments I saw here. It's a joy to see young people engaged within the Church, and dedicating themselves to each other before God. Good for you, and prayers for a wonderful life together!"

In the Middle Ages, the knee was bent in the presence of a king or nobleman. It was a mark of respect as well as a sign of allegiance. Over time, Christians adopted this custom. It was fully integrated into Roman liturgy from the 16th century onwards. Whereas genuflecting on the left knee was customary when revering a king, Christians decided to genuflect on the right knee, as a distinctive sign of respect towards God.\n\nand the english wikipedia page on genuflecting also talks about it  :  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genuflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genuflection)\n\n>It is often referred to as \"going down on one knee\" or \"bowing the knee\".In\u00a0[Western culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture):\n\n>one genuflects on the left knee to a human dignitary, whether ecclesiastical or civil;  \nin Christian churches and chapels, one genuflects on the right knee when the\u00a0[Sacrament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist)\u00a0is not exposed but in a\u00a0[tabernacle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_tabernacle)\u00a0or veiled.  \n  \nConversely, one kneels with both knees if the Sacrament is exposed.\n\nI see that there are some differences from the french custom regarding whether one should kneel on the left or right knee in front of an ecclesiastical dignitary"

It's not practical to just carry around a second pair of shoes 'on the off chance they go into a church' (obviously he knew they were going, but clearly she did not) and on top of that, they were visiting at church, not going to Mass. She acknowledged that they were out and about, hence her choice of skirt maybe not being everyone's choice. Never have I ever walked into a church and cared one iota what shoes I had on, and I've been to many many churches in America and in Europe (and yes, we intend to take pictures at ALL of them.

If you haven't read it I would suggest you go do so, otherwise this post won't make sense. \n\nI recieved a lot of comments and messages. Some of them were thoughtful, kind, and helpful, most of them were from this subreddit. But a lot of the responses i got on r/prolife told me that my sister is a liar, whore, child murderer, that this is all her fault, and that my parents and I would be justified in never speaking to her again. But when I look at my sister I don't see any of these things. I see a scared 16 year old girl. I see the girl who helped me get over my stutter. I see the girl who protected me from being bullied for so many years. I see the girl who always convinced me that I was good enough. I see the girl who needs my help right now. \n\nI've spent a lot of the day talking with people on reddit chats and in comments about how to help her. And despite all the horrible things I've heard said about my sister today, there were a some nice things as well. I spent a good chunk of the evening talking with her and we both ended up crying about what happened. \n\nShe gave me more details about what happened to her at the house party, details I won't share here, but what I will say is I wouldn't wish what she went through on anyone. Not even my worst enemy. \n\nI tried talking to our parents some more but they wouldn't listen to me. In their mind, what my sister did overshadows what happened to her. The more I think about it the more I realized they failed her when she first told them about what happened. They never comforted her, they just coldly gave her the option between therapy or legal action. And I think that was wrong of them. \n\nI feel like I failed my duty as a brother by being so quick to label her a monster like our parents have. And I'm trying to do everything in my power to make that up to her. \n\nAs for how I feel about her abortion? I don't know. I still don't think it was right, but I understand why she did it. I understand why she felt she didn't have any other options. \n\nThank you to everyone on this subreddit who was so kind and helpful. God bless all of you \u2764\ufe0f",

This is one of the most traumatic experience a woman let alone a young 16 year old girl to go through! \n\nShe needs love and compassion right now.

Some people do this to cope with traumatic events, by ignoring it and hoping it goes away, particularly those from older generations. They will most likely also need therapy.\n\nI'll be praying for your sister \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4f and for your healing and your parents healing also....\n\nEdit: all the ones saying the comments are fine, when I first went on there all the comments were not.

That line where justice and mercy meet, where truth and love meet. It's hard to know what to do. We say, \"look to Christ,\" but then it's like, \"Christ when he flipped the tables and whipped people or Christ giving the Beatitudes?\" \n\nWe don't want our love to become this toothless, saccharine, meaningless acceptance and tolerance of all evil. But we don't want to speak the truth in a way without love, or allow ourselves to fail to see the human person before us. \n\nI don't have all of the answers. But I think one thing I do know is that it's never wrong to sit with a person and listen, to meet them in the darkness of their life, to have their tears on your shoulder. You did the right thing to be there for your sister. I expect you will have challenges to come with this, as will she of course.

In the Encyclical Evangelium Vitae, Pope John Paul II wrote a special message to women who are post-abortive. He wrote,\n\n*\u201cI would now like to say a special word to women who have had an abortion. The Church is aware of the many factors which may have influenced your decision, and she does not doubt that in many cases it was a painful and even shattering decision. The wound in your heart may not yet have healed. Certainly what happened was and remains terribly wrong. But do not give in to discouragement and do not lose hope. Try rather to understand what happened and face it honestly. If you have not already done so, give yourselves over with humility and trust to repentance. The Father of mercies is ready to give you his forgiveness and his peace in the Sacrament of Reconciliation. To the same Father and his mercy you can with sure hope entrust your child. With the friendly and expert help and advice of other people, and as a result of your own painful experience, you can be among the most eloquent defenders of everyone\u2019s right to life. Through your commitment to life, whether by accepting the birth of other children or by welcoming and caring for those most in need of someone to be close to them, you will become promoters of a new way of looking at human life\u201d (99).*"

They forget so easily that our God is merciful and thus they neglect to mirror Him when it comes to circumstances such as your sister's. Catholics (and everyone else sharing the mindset of your parents and those so-called \"pro-lifers\") need to wake up and realize that women are human too, and to disregard women's well-being is exactly how even the most formerly devout of parishioners can eventually find themselves wanting to leave the Church and perhaps even bring themselves to go through with that if they get pushed far enough and see no other way to help themselves. To handwave away *a gang rape* and condemn *a rape victim* who acted out of literal PTSD-causing trauma and self-preservation is Pharisaical and thus utterly reprehensible. ***This*** is why so many people get the impression that Catholicism is misogynistic, and I don't blame them at all for getting that impression when so many people in the Church are literally being misogynistic! I say this as a Catholic woman myself.  \n\n\nPerhaps in time your sister might alter her perspective in some way about the aborted child but it's her trauma to process and no one else can or should tell her how to feel either way.

Confession is God's way to cleanse of of that remorse and straighten out paths to continue to follow in his footsteps and continue to correct our sinful behavior. It's not like she plans on making abortion her new solution to contraception or hopefully not trying to support it as a good thing. Discuss with her the importance of learning from the bad position she put herself in and avoiding those situations that may turn into this. She loves by Christ like any other sinner, all she has to do is accept God's grace, repent, have the intention to sin no more in her heart. Also let's hope she seeks counseling as these events can be mentally traumatic. God bless you both and let's all pray she can accept her error, accept God's grace, pray for the lost child, and not forget no matter how difficult it is to pray for the offenders of this situation that they too will acknowledge their sins, find Christ, and straighten their paths. \"Forgive our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us\" oh how I repeat this during the day multiple times. \ud83d\ude4f"

For you to try to fight for your parents about what happened with your sister. That is very brave because when my grandpa said that \u201cYou can\u2019t make through this school because of your right side paralysis\u201d I was mad and went to my dad but he didn\u2019t do anything because he doesn\u2019t ever think that his dad did anything wrong. I can count up to 3-4 instances since 2021 where my dad didn\u2019t stick up to his dad for me. So what you are doing is very brave. Now if it were me and my sister got an abortion I would still see her the same because I realized that everyone who is in or has been in this universe is/has been dealing with sin everyday and I just realized that in September of this year. I would just keep standing up for her to show her how great of a brother you are and to repay her back for being such a great sister to you. I don\u2019t know if she is religious or not but my sister isn\u2019t because of the kids we grew up with in the Catholic church where just mean to her and of course I didn\u2019t help her out because I was mean to her also and then when she split from Christianity I pushed her away farther from Christianity because I was telling her \u201cYou have to be a Christian and you have to believe that Jesus is Lord or else you are going to hell! and what it says in the Bible is true so you have to believe it! My last tangent was in April. So now my sister is so far from going back because all of the crap she was through. What I am trying to say is that Be nice to her and take her to a church that hates the sin but not the sinner. Because I want people to be that way and not at everyone\u2019s throat\u2019s. Plus the other reason why I said that is because I don\u2019t want to see anyone how I was.\nThe reason why I am nicer now is because I am on the right meds and I went to a mental health program that was 3 hours each day 3 days a week plus I\u2019ve realized you don\u2019t know what that person has/is going through. They could be getting the worst news of their life and a stranger being a Karen to them and then they feel worse. Although I was always nice to teachers except for maybe one and I was always nice to my elders. Anyways I hope this helps and just know you are doing a great job."

I feel for what she went through and how she must have felt but I also believe that this is the moment that you and your family has to be closer to her, help her, have compassion for what she went through and make her search and reach for God's forgiveness. We have to have compassion for the people that are around us. The act of abortion is currently one of the worst abominations of this generation, there are different cases and the one of your sister is part of the lower % on why abortions happen and to this %, we as Catholics, we have to be compassionate of the victim while rejecting the sin. My humble recommendation is that as a family, help your sister and find professional help and religious help. Get her a psychologist and a priest she can talk to. But mostly importantly, a priest and a good one. One that won't judge or question why she did it. She already did it, now it's time to work on repentance."

In this case, the post is a collection of comments that express support and compassion for someone who has had an abortion after being raped, and criticize those who condemn them without empathy. This type of response emphasizes personal freedom and individual choice while also promoting societal welfare by supporting those in need. Therefore, it leans towards a lightly libertarian stance.)",

The comments are largely filled with compassionate and supportive messages from Catholics on both sides of the abortion debate, with many calling for understanding, forgiveness, and healing.\n\nThe post does not contain any overtly political language or opinions that would lean it towards either side of the spectrum.

Godbless and may God give you strength in your journey towards him and may you Muslim family eventually convert to Catholic one day. Keep praying the Divine Mercy Chaplet and Rosary daily, maybe even twice or more daily. Morning and Night prayer is beneficial for your journey towards God especially to make your Spirit strong in him. Go participate in the Eucharist as much as possible, maybe every day even as this will strengthen your Spirit too and give you much much Graces. There will be hardships eventually but if you keep strong and focused on your faith properly then you'll overcome all obstacles. Many people who were baptized Catholic as babies only fall away because they weren't practicing Catholics or they didn't understand the importance of The Eucharist and the church history as they never educated themselves, eventually some come back once they understand things better, so that's great too. Godbless on your journey with God and all the Heavenly Saints. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f"

Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God\u2019s curse! As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God\u2019s curse!\u201d\n\nBut regardless, if your family choose to follow the truth or not, remember to love them still, and most importantly remember if anybody is to put a knife to your throat, a gun to your head and threaten your life, or the lives of others, do not renounce Jesus, but testify to him, for him, Jesus asked for this in Matthew 16:25 \u201cwhoever loses their life for me will find it.\u201d\n\nPlease be sure as well to familiarise yourself with the true Gospel, the words in the bible, as opposed to the false Gospel called Injil in the Quran.\n\nBesides Jesus in Islam makes absolutely no sense, as he does not save from anything according to the Muslims of the world, therefore, not the Messiah, as Messiah means saviour.\n\nAlso; God is true and benevolent, and as a perfect and true being, he cannot lie and deceive willingly, hence invalidating the claim from the Quran that he was replaced at the last minute.\n\nNot even to mention the abundance of Historical (Secular and non Muslim) and Archaeological evidence, to refute and disprove the claims of Islam.\n\n\u201cBut now, this is what the LORD says\u2014 he who created you, Jacob, he who formed you, Israel: \u201cDo not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine.\u201d \n- Isaiah 43:1"

Jesus knows your pain and concerns, hes not asking you to jump into the deep end but to have faith.\n\n2nd Ignoring theology for a second, there is so much historical and scientific facts in the quran that are just blatant wrong, like the earth being fat, sperm from the breastbone of a woman, etc. Historically the crucifixion of Jesus did happen, countless historians believe it and we have multiple sources to verify it from jewish historians to the early christians. Most historians also agree that the apostles believed they saw something associated with the resurrection of jesus. Now most historians dont believe in the supernatural so they dont believe in the resurrection  \nof Jesus, but they believe the apostles witnessed and believed that they saw him rise again. It couldnt be a hallucination because multiple people saw him in multiple environments. Paul writes how James, the brother of Jesus, who did not believe Jesus was the messiah during his ministry witnessed the resurrection and converted. Paul himself hunted christians and turned to believe in Christ. We have groups of the 12 who witnessed him, then large groups of 500 people. The apostles strongly believed they witnessed jesus and even so that all went on to be crucified, tortured, or killed for this belief. \n\nAll of this dismisses Islam instantly, as it says that jesus wasnt crucified, we know he was, also Islam believes that Jesus never claimed to be God, thats not true and all the apostles died preaching of Christ divinity. \n\nIn the end Islam is false either way. Even if Christianity is wrong, Christ still died disproving islam.\n\nHope that helps and feel free to message me for anything"

Honestly you came in peace and were curious so ill try to go through it.\n\nFirst the often argument of muslims against christianity is that the bible has been corrupted or falsified. I have tried researching this and i dont believe its true. We have the dead sea scrolls verifying the old testament before Jesus time. We also have huge amounts of manuscripts verifying the new testament. Sure verses have been added that we realized and have removed. But you cant do this in islam because all manuscripts have been burnt by Uthman. In fact the quran itself has different versions with different meanings and incorrect verses.\n\nFrom here if the bible is true the quran cant be true. \n\nNow there are more moral reasons for me in my conversion. I just however wanted to focus on the truth rather then my own experiences, so a skeptic could resonate more with those"

For example, Afghan law imposes the death penalty for both apostasy and blasphemy; following Sharia and proselytizing by non-Muslims is also a criminal offense; male apostates must be killed, females must be held in solitary confinement and beaten every three days until they retract and return to Islam. The crime of blasphemy includes anti-Islamic writings or speech and can be punished with the death penalty unless the accused retracts within three days. Islamic religious education is also required in state-run and private schools, even for non-Muslims.\n\nFurthermore, living openly as a Christian is impossible, and Christian converts face dire consequences if their new faith is discovered. As a result, converts to Christianity have two options: flee the country or risk being killed. Converts are often killed by their own families, clans, or tribes. Christians from a Muslim background have also been sent to a psychiatric hospital because leaving Islam is deemed a sign of insanity."

From there it came to reading church history, seeing how although the catholic church was near death, and possibly even in death (with corruption of indulgences, popes buying their seats, etc), Christ did not joke around when he said Peter is the rock of the church, and brought the church up from death multiple times.\n\n\nIt was a very hard and long journey, and one I still am learning and afraid of walking on, but I trust God to guide me wherever he needs me.

When I was a kid islam and quran doesn't make sense to me. I used to read about Isa in quran and he wasn't just like a normal prophet, I used to question why was the purpose of his miraculous birth? What purpose did he fulfilled? He lived and decieved 3 billion people? Then I start reading bible when I was 17 and it made sense. Something can't be created from nothing like his birth, who didn't had father. Even in quran muhammad died, Musa died, Ibrahim died but Isa didn't die, but he didn't fullfill any messianic prophecy. Then I start reading books about early islam and how people like St. John of damascus wrote books like \"heresy of ishmaelites\". After doing my research for like 3 to 4 year I finally became christian. Quran is very contradictory as it confirms the past scriptures, it says people of the book to judge according to their book. Then muslims say ohh the bible is corrupted, but then why would allah ask people of the book to judge by their corrupted book? If you wanna have formal debate, I can do that too. Or write contradictions in bible and I'll refute all your points."

Islam's \"holy prophet\" set the explicit example for pedophilia by \"marrying\" a 6yo little girl then ~~consummating~~ raping her at 9yo. This is according to the most reliable of Islam's own texts. \n\nBut Mohammed didn't *only* like little girls. Also according to Islamic texts, he enjoyed sucking on the tongues and lips of little boys. He liked to put his tongue in the mouths of little boys, too. Mohammed also pushed a little boy's legs apart and put his mouth on the boy's penis.\n\nWhat about babies crawling on the floor? Mohammed saw one and immediately proposed. What kind of sick freak hears wedding bells when he looks at an infant? The \"holy prophet\" of Islam, of course!\n \nThanks to Mohammed, raping children became deeply ingrained in the Islamic culture. For centuries, Muslim armies have been purging Christian, Jewish, Hindu and other villages of their men and sending the women and children to thriving rape slave markets deep in the Islamic world, rape slave markets that still exist today."

Father Jeff let me know that our religions go hand in hand and that I should go to experience culture.\n\nIt was beautiful, they had readings and a homily. There were definitely parts I didn\u2019t agree with, the women have to sit in the balcony and the men worship on the main floor.

                "content": "That's a common *dawah* (propaganda) technique that Muslims use on outsiders. They simply dismiss anything in Islam that clashes with Western mores as being outdated and no longer practiced. \n\nThey are lying to you. They are hoping you are unaware that Islamic teachings are absolute and cannot be challenged or changed. \n\nLying to non-Muslims is allowed. They don't have any concept of the Golden Rule and lying is not a sin, especially when it furthers the aims of Islam. \n\nMohammed established only two experts in Islam: himself and their god Allah. The Koran, which is the word of Allah, was not created. It exists unto itself in perpetuity in Muslim heaven. Even if you change the words of a Koran here on Earth, the Koran in Muslim heaven remains unaltered. The Koran is therefore unchangeable. In fact, the Koran itself repeatedly says this.\n\nAllah managed to hand down quite a few \"revelations\" that sanctioned Mohammed's personal pursuit of sex and rape to any doubters around him. The \"holy prophet of Islam\" had sex with just about anyone he pleased. \n\nBizarrely, this is all in the Koran. It is unclear why these personal directives should be a part of Allah\u2019s universal and unchanging word to all of mankind but it's in there. \n\nA pass for pedophiles is part of the Koran. Allah's word condones raping underage girls. Mohammed's sexual assault and rape of young children is further documented in *ahadith,* holy texts of the words and deeds of Mohammed. These are second only to the Koran in their importance.\n\nMohammad's sexual antics are acutely embarrassing to Muslims. This is particularly so regarding the ~~consummation~~ rape of his favorite child-bride, 9yo Aisha. \n\nThe thought of a 50-something man raping and bathing with a little girl is repulsive and reflects the disgusting character of a sexual pervert, not a holy man.\n\nYet Mohammed is *also* \"a beautiful pattern of conduct for anyone whose hope is in Allah\" and \"an exalted standard of character\" whom Muslims are to emulate in every way. \n\nEvery word of the Koran, and every word and deed of Mohammed are perfect, complete, and eternal. They are for all people and all eras. Once you change something in Islam it is no longer Islamic. You would have simply created a new cult.\n\nContemporary clerics warn Muslims against succumbing to the disapproval of child \"marriage\" in the the West: \"It behooves those who call for setting a minimum age for marriage to fear Allah and not contradict his Sharia, or try to legislate things Allah did not permit. For laws are Allah\u2019s province; and legislation is his exclusive right, to be shared by none other. And among these are the rules governing marriage.\" Salih bin Fawzan, prominent cleric and member of Saudi Arabia\u2019s highest religious council.\n\nListen to what Muslims tell *each other,* not what they tell outsiders -- which is often not the truth."

There is no mention or implication of advocating for government control or authoritarian policies, and most comments focus on congratulating and supporting the author's decision.",
        "left_to_right_rating": "Based on the comments and the post itself, I would rate this post a 7.\n\nThe language used by many commenters is overwhelmingly positive and celebratory, with phrases like \"Welcome Home!\", \"God bless you\", \"Congratulations\", and \"Praise be to God\". The tone of the comments suggests a strong sense of community and support among Catholic followers. While there are some comments that could be interpreted as mildly politicized (e.g., Ok_Spare_3723's call for building cathedrals in the Middle East), they do not appear to be radical or extreme.\n\nThe post itself is about an individual's personal spiritual journey, which tends to be a more apolitical topic. The image of a baptismal ceremony is a universal and non-partisan symbol of faith and renewal. Overall, I would place this post on the right side of the spectrum, but at a moderate point that does not lean far towards either left or right."

Even on his deathbed, he remained a faithful physician, for after he received the Last Rites, he was wheeled out in front of a class of medical students, so that they could see a man dying of leukemia.\n\nHe was also a strong advocate of peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  Rather than fearing it on account of nuclear weapons, as some chose to, he saw using nuclear power as beating swords into plowshares."

That could be a whole convo on its own. But, once Tommy Lasorda and Vin Scully died, current ownership (a major investment firm) decided it was time to up the ESG/DEI score I guess. \n\nThe year before the \u201cSisters\u201d were invited, the guest of honor at Pride Night was Fallon Fox, the transgender MMA fighter who was severely injuring his female opponents. So, I was already starting to feel a bit distanced from the organization already. \n\nThe Angels have cheaper tickets/parking/concessions. Security does a better job of preserving a family friendly atmosphere. And, they now host a Catholic Night in conjunction with the Diocese of Orange. For those reasons, I can honestly call myself an Angels fan now."

They responded by killing or exiling all of the priests and anyone who could speak Latin or Portugese and implementing a persecution even fiercer than the Roman Empire.  In those days, there was no Japanese translation of the Bible.  Unlike the Roman persecutions, which were sporadic, the Tokugawa persecution was constant and thorough, fiercely testing the population for signs of secret Christians and paying heavy bounties for anyone who turned one in to the authorities, especially those who had returned to Christianity after apostatizing.  Nevertheless, the Christians passed down their faith to their descendants orally, along with the signs by which they could recognize priests and missionaries when they eventually returned.  After Commodore Perry forced Japan to reopen to the world, missionaries returned to Japan, only to amazed that there were already Catholics there.  Even the Pope called their survival a miracle."

There were two windows on either side of the altar, high up, and when the light shone through in the evening at vespers, it would fall directly onto the golden cross and make it glow like fire, while casting two shadows on the wall behind. The effect created was an illusion of three crosses behind the altar- two in shadow, and one blazing with light. So beautiful, and so clearly intentional."

        "libertarian_to_authoritarian_rating": "Based on the comments, I would rate this post a 4, which means lightly authoritarian. The majority of the comments are light-hearted and humorous, with some users joking about the bishop looking like a wizard or Gandalf. However, there are also several comments that express mild disapproval or criticism of the bishop's vestments, suggesting a desire for more traditional or formal attire. One user even states that the vestments \"scream Sorry!\", implying a sense of embarrassment or shame. Overall, while the tone is not overtly critical, it suggests a subtle preference for more established norms and traditions, which leans towards authoritarianism.",
        "left_to_right_rating": "2 \n\nThe post title and comments suggest a neutral or apolitical tone, with some humorous and lighthearted commentary on the image. The discussion is centered around the aesthetics of the Archbishop's vestments and the ceremonial staff, rather than any ideological or partisan issues. There are some comments that mention the cathedral and its significance, but these are not framed in a way that suggests a particular political leaning. Overall, the tone of the post and comments leans slightly towards the center-right, as it celebrates tradition and cultural heritage without taking an overtly political stance."

For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only He who now restrains will do so until He is taken out of the way.\n\n\n\ud83d\udc51\u2728Jesus\u2728 said that the end of days will be like Noah and in Lot times\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\u2728: Luke 17:26-30 And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. (Jesus Return) They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they build, But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.\nEven thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.\n\u00a0\nThe Bible said in Noah times it was violent (Genesis 6:13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth)\n\n\nAnd in Lots time was major sexual immorality.\n\n\nSo I believe violence and sexual immorality is all apart of the lawlessness/antichrist spirit ( satan)\nChrist said \"as in the days of Noah and Lot\".\u00a0\n\u2728 T O D A Y\u2728Violence is happening everywhere\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\u2728\ud83e\udd7a\nAnd sexual immorality is rampant\u2728\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd ( trafficking, and the lgbtq, and lustful spirit)\n\n\nThe Bible says hearts will grow cold due to Lawlessness \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\u2728\u00a0\nMatthew 24:12-13 \u2728\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\nAnd because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold.

NOT referring to Trinitarian Christian sects but OTHER RELIGIONS.\n\nIn 2017 he abolished the Vatican's Special Mission to the Jews which is every bit as old as Christianity ITSELF.\u00a0\n\nHe essentially embraces some variation of Dual-Covenant Theology, a highly deviant and dangerous heresy rooted in Christian Zionism which states that the Jews have their own linear covenant with GOD.\n\nHe forbade RC's from saying - or singing - the word \"Yahweh\" or the English variant \"Jehovah\" on the grounds it's offensive to Jews. Seriously has anyone googled what the Talmud has to say about Jesus and Mary ??? Look it up ! Make sure you are sitting down because you will stagger after reading the atrocious words.\n\nHe has repeatedly protected p\u20acd0phile priests and not held the Church to accountability.\u00a0\n\nIn Argentina, he embezzled funds from the Archdiocese and protected p\u20acdo clergymen shuffling them from one parish to another, foisting them on innocent children \ud83e\udd2c\n\nSeriously need we go on or do you need more?\n\n\nAs a side note, Hell is NOT empty, despite that moronic pronouncement.

Popes have always voiced personal opinions, the fact that many people seem incapable (or unwilling) to understand what papal infallibility means is out of his control. Many people also refuse to listen or read what he actually says and base their criticism off inflammatory media articles and YouTube videos. \n\nPopes are, by definition, global personalities, this is nothing new in the slightest.

                "content": "I completely disagree. While Francis is undoubtedly a charismatic, vibrant figure, I believe his papacy has been fraught with confusion and mixed messages that have caused unnecessary division within the Church. For example, his infamous comment \"Who am I to judge?\" regarding homosexuality, while taken out of context by the media, was so poorly framed that it led to widespread misunderstanding about Church teaching. Similarly, his endorsement of \"civil unions\" for same-sex couples caused an uproar, with many questioning how this aligns with traditional Catholic doctrine on marriage.\n\nThe claim that he is entirely orthodox in his teaching is debatable when his actions and words sometimes seem to conflict with long-standing traditions. For instance, his restrictions on the Latin Mass through Traditionis Custodes alienated many Catholics who felt connected to the Church's traditional liturgy. This move seemed unnecessarily divisive, especially given Pope Benedict XVI's earlier efforts to foster unity through Summorum Pontificum.\n\nWhile papal infallibility is indeed limited to ex cathedra proclamations, the pope's every word carries immense weight. It is his responsibility to ensure clarity, yet Francis has often left the faithful scrambling to interpret ambiguous statements, such as his comments about divorced and remarried Catholics in Amoris Laetitia. These remarks left bishops worldwide divided over whether this opened the door to Communion for those in irregular unions, undermining unity within the Church.\n\nMoreover, while humility and compassion are admirable qualities, they cannot come at the cost of doctrinal clarity. A pope is not merely a global personality or political figure but the spiritual leader of over a billion Catholics. His primary duty is to safeguard the faith and provide clear, unwavering guidance\u2014not to create situations where Catholics must sift through media misrepresentations or controversial remarks to discern the Church's actual teachings."

At all times we carry in our mortal bodies the death of Jesus, so that his life also may be seen in our bodies. Throughout our lives we are always in danger of death for Jesus' sake, in order that his life may be seen in this mortal body of ours.\u201d*** **(2 Cor 6:7-11)**"

Jesus didn\u2019t use full power, but instead a proper display of perfect strength in holding back in an appearance of weakness. When Satan tempted Jesus, Jesus didn\u2019t snap his fingers and destroy Satan instantly for his transgression, and instead rebuked him from an appearance of weakness (And maybe actual weakness he took upon, as he was starved 40 days) as a testimony for many to learn from who have weakness. I personally love the post because it shows Jesus can cross up Satan and break his ankles no issue, 3-0 with no fouls. It was never a close match, but it was a needed one for something better.\n\nSome would call Jesus not instantly obliterating Satan as a mercy to Satan, or a weakness from Christ, but no it was instead likely that we could learn from Jesus and Satans actions from their encounter, with Jesus holding back strength and having an appearance of weakness, to show what perfect strength looks like in weakness, as the scripture says \u201cMy strength is made perfect in weakness\u201d\n\nSatan is already judged. It was not a mercy to Satan, but instead a logical earnest and promise to his torment in the lake of fire."

The poster is fine; Jesus definitely had a sense of humour. \"May he who has not sinned cast the first stone\"; prefect example of a serious situation where Jesus brilliantly makes a point by [possibly playfully] making everyone self reflect & instantly recognize that they're being major assholes.\n\n2. I'm not even seeing Jesus breaking Satan's ankle; all I see is Jesus dominating Satan on the court via faking him out super hard. If Satan were to break his ankle here, it'd mostly be of his own doing and due to his own inadequacy. Jesus is merely outplaying and out-maneuvering the devil here; it's not aggressive or violent.\n\n3. Some might take issue with Jesus's image being placed into a different ['not holy nor Biblical'] context, but, I'd argue when Jesus was here, for all intents & purposes, he was a travelling human philosopher, and he most certainly had a sense of humour. This obsession with making Jesus an exclusively spiritual figure (& stripping away his humanity in the process) is something other historical powers emphasized later due to various interests; it's why [for example] not all gospels were included in the Bible (which, again, I can't stress enough, is a HUMAN construct). The MAN Jesus is hidden behind the veil of the Bible's human creators, who decided amongst themselves what would be most important & relevant to include based on their beliefs & needs (ex. Christianity used to be very fractured & rife with disagreement between groups, thus, attempts were eventually made to create unity & cohesion via order & concensus, which ultimately formed the Jesus brand of today).\n\nAll in all, your poster is fine; there's nothing wrong with Jesus rocking the court in a 1-on-1 match against Satan, and there's certainly nothing wrong with showing your friend you appreciate their efforts to bestow a gift or act of kindness unto you (aka: gratitude). If you like the poster, put it up; Jesus won't be upset :) ... ... Plus, he's got way bigger things to worry about right now than your poster anyway! :P :)"

I grew up in a parish named St Michael the Archangel in the 50s. We had statue with Michael on top of the devil with his foot on his head. We got a new pastor in the late 60s and he removed it. He told us he did so not because of the message of  God overcoming evil, but because Michael was obviously white and the devil was portrayed as a black man, down to the curly hair on his head.  Not a message he,  nor his flock, should be, supporting. I was just a kid then. But his action left a big impression on me.  Art conveys meaning in more than its mage.

It was never a fair fight, but it was a needed one for something better.\n\nEdit: Some would call Jesus not instantly obliterating Satan as a mercy to Satan, but no it was instead likely that we could learn from Jesus and Satans actions from their encounter, with Jesus holding back strength and having an appearance of weakness, to show what perfect strength looks like in weakness, as the scripture says \u201cMy strength is made perfect in weakness\u201d"

Please don\u2019t accuse me of reading the bible wrong when it\u2019s been the dominant Jewish view for thousands of years and still is today.\n\nA few things:\n\nFirst, you are misreading Kaufmann's wiki page. From the page:\n\n>Kaufmann was the first to take up the history of art in the synagogue, challenging the prevalent view that Judaism had always been aniconic. **He marshalled a large and comprehensive corpus of data in order to prove it \\[Aniconic Judaism\\] untenable.**  (Emphasis Mine)\n\nAdditionally from the Aniconic Judaism Page:\n\n>In a refutation of the belief in an aniconic Judaism, and more generally in an underestimation of Jewish visual arts, the historian of ideas Kalman **Bland recently proposed that the phenomenon \\[Aniconic Judaism\\] is a modern construction, and that \"Jewish aniconism crystallized simultaneously with the construction of modern Jewish identities\".** (Emphasis Mine)\n\nSecond, Kaufmann being from the 19th century is entirely irrelevant to the truth of the matter, if anything it shows that ancient Aniconic Judaism has been disproven for that long.\n\nThird, I'm allowed to accuse you of misreading the bible if I believe you're misreading the bible. I've pointed out where your bible quote lacked the critical context that the second commandment was given with an express purpose to prevent the Jews from *worshipping* the prohibited items.\n\nYou haven't provided one scintilla of evidence to support your assertion that your interpretation of the second commandment is and always has been the dominant view of Judaism and, on the contrary, I've produced scholarship that's had over a century to be evaluated demonstrating that Aniconic Judaism was at the very least not, in fact, a uniform and ancient practice.\n\nBut I would remind you that the Jesus consistently clashed with the Pharisees, who are the forerunners of Rabbinic Judaism and were among those who kept the law in biblical Israel, hence why they consistently challenged Jesus when they perceived him to be doing something they *felt* violated the law. Jesus healed on the sabbath, in opposition to the pharisees, allowed his disciples to violate the ritual washing before meals, in opposition to the pharisees, and drove out money changers from the temple, who somebody in religious authority had surely allowed there. The Gospels prove over and over again that the law the Pharisees preached differed wildly from the law God actually demanded his children follow, so if you're going to appeal to Jesus and Jewish law simultaneously you're citing sources often in conflict to put it mildly. The divine moral law is immutable, but many cultural rules or man-made interpretations of that divine law were rebuked by Christ and his closest Apostles immediately after his death.\n\nAs for your bible quotes, they're non-sequiturs, we're currently in disagreement over what the meaning of this commandment is, not if we have to follow it."

                "content": "The story of Our Lady of the Rosary is deeply connected to the Battle of Lepanto, one of the most significant naval battles in European history, where Christian forces achieved a miraculous victory over the Ottoman Turks. This event is celebrated by Catholics as a sign of divine intervention, attributed to the intercession of the Virgin Mary through the recitation of the Rosary.\n\n\nBackground:\n\n\nIn the mid-16th century, the Ottoman Empire, under Sultan Selim II, was expanding its influence and posed a significant threat to Christian Europe. The Ottomans sought to control the Mediterranean, conquer Europe, and spread Islam. Pope Pius V, understanding the gravity of the situation, called for the formation of a Holy League, a coalition of Catholic states, to defend Christendom against the Turks.\n\n\nThe Holy League consisted mainly of the naval forces from Spain, Venice, the Papal States, and several smaller European states. It was led by Don Juan of Austria, the illegitimate half-brother of King Philip II of Spain. The Turkish fleet, commanded by Ali Pasha, was much larger and more experienced than the Christian forces.\n\n\nThe Battle of Lepanto (October 7, 1571):\n\n\nThe two fleets met on October 7, 1571, near the Gulf of Patras, off the western coast of Greece, in what became known as the Battle of Lepanto. The Christian fleet was significantly outnumbered, and the Ottomans had a fearsome reputation as the dominant naval power of the time. It seemed unlikely that the Christian forces would win.\n\n\nHowever, Pope Pius V had called upon all Christians to pray the Rosary for the victory of the Holy League. He asked that special prayers be offered to Our Lady of the Rosary, seeking her intercession for protection and victory over the Turks. The faithful across Europe responded, especially the members of the Confraternity of the Holy Rosary, who fervently prayed for the Christian soldiers.\n\n\nMiraculous Victory:\n\n\nDespite being outnumbered and facing a superior Ottoman fleet, the Christian forces achieved a decisive victory. The battle resulted in the destruction of a large part of the Ottoman fleet, the capture of many Turkish ships, and the freeing of thousands of Christian slaves who had been rowing in the Turkish galleys. The victory at Lepanto was seen as miraculous and as a turning point in the defence of Europe against Ottoman expansion.\n\n\nLegend says that at the exact moment of the victory, Pope Pius V, who was in Rome, had a divine vision of the battle's outcome. Upon hearing the news of the triumph, he declared that it was through the intercession of the Virgin Mary and the power of the Rosary that the Christian forces had prevailed.\n\n\nThe Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary:\n\n\nIn thanksgiving for this miraculous victory, Pope Pius V established the Feast of Our Lady of Victory to be celebrated on October 7. His successor, Pope Gregory XIII, later renamed the feast to Our Lady of the Rosary. The feast honours the power of the Rosary and the role of the Virgin Mary in the victory.\n\n\nThe battle and the subsequent feast have come to symbolize the power of prayer, particularly the Rosary, and the protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary in times of great need. The title Our Lady of the Rosary is a reminder of how Mary is seen as a powerful intercessor who can bring about peace and victory through prayer.\n\n\nSignificance:\n\n\nThe victory at Lepanto halted the Ottoman expansion into Europe and is considered one of the greatest naval victories in history. It is remembered as a moment when Christian Europe, united in faith and prayer, overcame a formidable threat. The Rosary became more widely promoted as a spiritual weapon, and the feast of Our Lady of the Rosary continues to be celebrated in the Catholic Church, especially on October 7 each year.\n\n\nThis story of Our Lady of the Rosary is a powerful reminder of the belief in the efficacy of prayer, particularly the Rosary, and of the Virgin Mary\u2019s special protection over those who seek her intercession."

Replacement Theology:\n\n\nIn his homilies, Chrysostom advances a perspective often referred to as \"replacement theology\" or \"supersessionism.\" This view asserts that because the Jews rejected Jesus as the Messiah, they lost their status as God\u2019s chosen people, a role that was subsequently taken up by the Christian Church.\n\n\nFor instance, Chrysostom states: \u201cThe Jews, because they killed Christ, have lost their place in God's family, and the Church has taken their place.\u201d This view reflects a belief that the \"people of God\" are no longer defined by ethnic lineage or adherence to Jewish law but by faith in Christ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Condemnation of Jewish Practices:\n\n\nChrysostom criticizes Jewish customs and festivals, calling them \"superstitions.\" He condemns Christians who attended synagogues or observed Jewish festivals, seeing such actions as a betrayal of Christian identity.\n\n\nIn Homily 1, he argues: \u201cWhat is this disease? It is the synagogue. It is the Jewish feast days and fasts... You must not come to church in this way, forsaking the assembly of the brethren to run to the synagogue of the Jews.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Accusations Against the Jews:\n\n\nChrysostom makes several inflammatory accusations against Jewish people, attributing various negative qualities to them. He accuses them of stubbornness, blindness to the truth, and moral corruption. His language is harsh and derogatory, and he frequently employs stereotypes.\n\n\nIn Homily 5, he writes: \u201cThe synagogue is worse than a brothel\u2026 It is a den of scoundrels and the repair of wild beasts\u2026 a place of shame for the wicked\u2026 the domicile of the devil, as is also the soul of the Jews.\u201d"

Also it seems to me that the Turks were very much reaching the limits of the logistical capabilities when they attacked Vienna, Austria multiple times. It took them a long time to prepare, launch and arrive for each attack in the campaigning season. To think Lepanto would have opened the way for an invasion of France, Spain and England seems preposterous. \n\nAgain not trying to say it wasn't of major significance but I think evidence that all of Christianity in the West hung in balance is not supported by the evidence."

Although the Ottomans promoted trade, they also used force to expand, as seen at Famagusta.\n\nAs for the Habsburgs, they did support the Holy League at Lepanto, providing key resources, demonstrating that, in this case, they did not avoid conflict with the Ottomans."

                "content": "Now, wait a minute. Your description of the Battle of Lepanto significantly distorts the facts. The Battle of Lepanto was nothing more than a naval engagement in the context of a struggle for control of the eastern Mediterranean. \n\n1. The engagement was not an \"unprovoked\" attack by Venice against the Ottoman Empire. In fact, in the preceding years, the Ottomans had invaded and occupied Cyprus, a strategically important Venetian possession, following the brutal siege of Famagusta (1570). During this siege, the Ottomans massacred a large part of the Venetian garrison and even executed the governor Marcantonio Bragadin. The creation of the Holy League was therefore not an act of aggression, but a coordinated response to the Ottoman threat and maritime expansion.\n\n2. Lepanto was a strictly military battle, between two war fleets. It was not an indiscriminate \"invasion\" or an attack on merchant ships. Spanish, Venetian and other Christian galleys and forces attacked exclusively Ottoman military vessels in the Gulf of Patras, and there is no record of the Christian fleet attacking civilian or merchant ships in this engagement.\n\n3. A significant part of the Ottoman galleys were manned by enslaved rowers (many of whom, it is true, were Christian captives). However, when the Christian forces defeated the Ottomans, one of the consequences was precisely the liberation of thousands of these enslaved rowers. Thus, many contemporary sources narrate the liberation of up to 12,000 Christian prisoners. \n\n4. The suggestion that there were \"peaceful riots\" on Ottoman ships due to internal religious divisions has no basis in historiography. The Ottoman forces at Lepanto were organised like any imperial navy of the time. While some Ottoman crews included captured Christians, the structure of the fleet and its military organisation did not encourage internal religious divisions, and there is no evidence of mutiny in the sources. \n\n5. Casualty figures indicate that the Ottoman fleet suffered most of the losses, with approximately 30,000 killed or captured, while Holy League casualties amounted to some 10,000 killed and wounded. In other words, there was no massacre of helpless rowers, as you suggest, but the engagement was one of the greatest naval battles in history, with both forces suffering heavy casualties in open conflict.\n\n6. Finally, the reference to the \"desecration of Ottoman cultural insignia\" was neither unique to Lepanto nor indicative of a particularly abusive action. In naval warfare at the time, capturing enemy flags was a symbol of victory, and both sides did so."

In 1571, they even raided cities on the Spanish coast, such as Malaga. \n\nThe idea that the Ottomans were 'more moral, peaceful and fair' than the Europeans is then a simplification; both sides used war and plunder as geopolitical tools in the struggle for Mediterranean hegemony."

Cyprus had been part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and then passed to Venetian control in 1489, long before the Ottomans considered it part of their sphere. Moreover, the island was strategic for Venetian trade, not a massive 'military facility'. Although Venice reinforced defences, Cyprus remained primarily a trading centre.\n\nThe Ottoman invasion in 1570 was a clear territorial expansion. The seizure of Famagusta and the subsequent massacre was not a simple \"pre-emptive strike\", but an expansionist aggression. Blaming Venice alone omits the Ottoman imperialist context in the Mediterranean."

The accusations were deemed false by the police but by that time the damage was done to their reputation. So after that they started having a larger online presence, such as several YouTube channels.\n\n\nTo put it shortly, they\u2019re a dissident group from the original brazilian TFP after the founder, Plinio Correa de Oliveira, died in the 1990\u2019s. Plinio\u2019s closest student, Jo\u00e3o Cl\u00e1 Dias wanted to form a feminine branch of the TFP and seek approval from Rome. Two factions were formed (one with Jo\u00e3o and his followers that wanted to seek a religious life, and other which wanted to focus on political and civil action). From this schism was born the Plinio Correa de Oliveira Institute, the continuation of the TFP, and the Heralds of the Gospel (Arautos do Evangelho), founded by Jo\u00e3o in 1999 or so.\n\n\nIn 2003 pope St John Paul II recognized the Heralds as an International Association of Pontifical Right. In the following years they founded a society of apostolic life for priests and a feminine order for sisters. Jo\u00e3o got the title of \u201cMonsignior\u201d from Pope Benedict XVI. They have schools, seminaries and a lot of churches. \n\n\nRecently the Vatican did an investigation on the orthodoxy of the group, conducted by brazilian cardinal Dom Damasceno. The association is currently under intervention under this cardinal. The relationship between them and the Vatican is amicable, though they refused the first intervention because in the Vatican document they referred to them as a \u201cpublic association\u201d, when they\u2019re private, which could potentially change the way the intervention went. The media showed this is an act of disobedience, but the Vatican did correct the document and they submitted to the intervention.\n\n\nOverall there\u2019s some shady stuff about them, but honestly you\u2019ll only find them if you dig deep. On the surface they do a very good evangelization work. They offer a beautiful Novus Ordo mass (you\u2019d think they\u2019re a TLM only kind of group) and are very conservative."

In fact we have more in common with Islam than anyone will admit at least in the west. The major threat here is not religious violence but secular philosophy. \n\n2nd what did the church do when the Romans came to sack Jerusalem?  Nothing, in fact it was what made the Jews call a council to denounce all Christians as heretics because the Church refused to fight against the pagan Romans,  when they also seeded the Church with the blood of the martyrs it was martyrs that did not die fighting but died defending the true faith, like Ignatius whom wrote against heresies even though he was a to be eaten by lions. Even the first ecumenical council at canon   12 can be interpreted in a pacifist  way. \n\nUnlike Islam it was not swords or military  might that converted the heart of the Romans, it was the martyrs, our charity, our perseverance and our forgiveness  of others.

They have a whole section dedicated to twisting a passage from exodus where God says you can\u2019t worship Moloch, to allowing it but only on Saturdays.\n\nThis is confirmed in Acts 7:43 where it says they have taken up the tabernacle of Moloch and the star of Remphan. If you look up the Star of David it didn\u2019t come into being until the third century, well after Christ\u2019s death and it didn\u2019t become prominently used in Judaism until the 1500\u2019s. We have no evidence where the \u201cstar of David\u201d came from because it\u2019s the star of remphan.\n\nHere are some other Bible quotes on the subject:\n\n1 Thessalonians 2:15 words of Paul who knew Talmudic Judaism better than you or I do.\nMathew 27:24-25 \nRevelation 2:9\nRevelation 3:9\n\nPlus Revelation talks about how in the end they will realize their long awaited messiah is actually the antichrist and 2/3 of the Jews in the last days will convert to Catholicism while many gentiles will leave the faith. The Talmud mentions the awaited \u201cmessiah\u201d and says that every Jewish person will get over 1,000 gentile slaves, not exactly the type of messiah I want.\n\nThis is a video made by a Jewish man who does typical question and answer videos in the streets of Jerusalem, primarily over Palestinian Israel conflicts. He went around asking people if they knew about the passage in the Talmud that says their awaited messiah will allow for over 1000 gentile slaves:\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/M60FUPVtq9k"

Whether that means the old covenant is dissolved or not is up to interpretation. What matters most, though, is Jesus forged a new covenant, which as you said supersedes the old.\n\nI am what you would call a partial preterist. This is to say that I believe that that many of Revelation and Matthew's prophecies are fulfilled to some degree. I hold this veiw because, if it were false, the Apostles and Jesus were phony prophets, and we know that Jesus can't be a liar, and his chosen few, while human, where the closest to him and the foremost agents of his will in the early Church Age.\n\nJesus claimed the end of the Age was 'coming soon', and that his apostles would not finish preaching throughout Judah before he returned in their own lifetimes. We know Jesus didn't return for his second coming in the 1st century, so he was a liar- wrong! Jesus didn't return in the 1st Century for his second physical coming- but he did come in Judgement of Israel for their iniquity, and he did deliver his faithful from God's wrath, as Christians living in Jerusalem were aware of the prophecy and fled to the mountains when Jerusalem was surrounded by Rome's armies. 170 Million was the approximate World Population in the 1st Century- 1.1 Million Jews were slaughtered on the seige of Jerusalem in 70 AD, alongside 100,000 in Galilee- add in the 97,000 enslaved, and that's 90% or more of all Jews alive killed or enslaved- that's worse statistically than even the Holocaust. \n\nThat being said, I heed the Lord's words, and I keep my lantern lit- never know when he could come back in glory, or when I'll come to him; life is short and unpredictable. It is possible that the Words of Matthew had a dual connotation, and indeed, there are still prophecies unfulfilled- I just live my life and trust that God's Will shall be done."

Pope Francis delivered a message that the entire planet, not Christendom alone, has been aching for: we are not God, and our wealth and technological sophistication is not adequate to save us. We need God.\n\nThe rain, the empty square, the visuals of a single man made to look so minutely small but delivering a message of such importance - it was almost too much for we who are weary of heart and soul to bear. \n\nWhen the service had concluded, and the camera was panning around the square, there were a couple of moments when it did a slow zoom in on the Miraculous Crucifix. That, combined with the dark Italian sky, the rain pouring down and dripping from our Lord's blood-covered brow, with only the sound of the rain falling - it was, truly, a beautiful moment.\n\nI expect that whatever happens with the Coronavirus, and whatever becomes of Pope Francis' pontificate, this will be a moment in the history of the Church that is long remembered and reflected on.\n\n  \nDeo gratias, quia Franciscus Pontifex."

The tone is one of reverence, respect, and admiration for the Pope's leadership and spiritual guidance. There is no mention or advocacy for individual freedom, government control, or any other political ideology that would place this post on the libertarian-authoritarian spectrum.",
        "left_to_right_rating": "Based on the post and comments, I would rate this post as -1.\n\nThe tone of the discussion is overwhelmingly respectful and reverent towards Pope Francis and the Catholic Church, with many commenters expressing admiration for his message and actions during the pandemic. The language used is not radical or extreme in any direction, and there are no mentions of socialism, communism, nationalism, or authoritarianism. The focus is on spiritual guidance and comfort during a time of crisis.\n\nThe only slightly political comment is from Rock-it1, who mentions that Pope Francis delivered a message about the limitations of human power and the need for God's intervention, which some might interpret as a subtle critique of neoliberalism or capitalist excesses. However, this comment does not dominate the conversation, and the overall tone remains neutral to slightly left-leaning due to its emphasis on social welfare and collective well-being."

Grace is what makes one grow in the virtues. Given that faith is a virtue, JP would need to humble himself (as we all should) to admit that the Lord is the one who makes it all possible, not by any mere human efforts. We never decide before we're born what we'll find. We are mere seekers of the oportunities that the Lord grants us. We never create those posibilities, we only find them. The moment we realize that everything we live is a gift and redirect ourselves to a constant state of gratitude towards the Lord and seek Him in the sacraments to make it possible, we start to live in a neverending joy and love unmatchable. No man in history before, during or after Christ is able to live the perfect life required to enter heaven. No one goes to the Father except through Jesus, the one and only who lived the perfect self sacrificial life to make it possible. No one besides Jesus is able to redeem himself. The moment we truly start loving God first, we start to truly love everyone else and ourselves. One can't love oneself by mere human efforts, but by loving the body of Christ, one sees both the pain that is inflicted upon others or oneself as a true suffering of Christ. One starts dressing with decorum to carry the Body of Christ in oneself because you love God, and not because of vanity. And every other virtue that comes along with His grace to be able to fulfil the will of God in everyone of us. It is the one and only way to fulfil one's life. No one fulfils his own life if it's not by becoming part of the Body of Christ: The One and Only who could say *tetelestai*."

If it were as easy as \u201cThomas Aquinas made this argument, read it and then you will convert\u201d then we would basically have no issues to begin with.\n\nThe Protestant Reformers like Luther were very familiar with Aquinas and Augustine. If you ever read Luther\u2019s actual writings, he is always quoting Augustine. The philosophers who brought down the Scholastic project and Aristotelian metaphysics (like Descartes, Hume, Kant, etc.) were all familiar (at the professional academic level) with Aristotle, Aquinas, Augustine, etc.\n\nThere are many people who read the apologetics and aren\u2019t moved by them, consider them to be flawed, etc. I think it\u2019s much more likely that Peterson simply wasn\u2019t moved to conversion than that he simply never looked into the major points of Catholic apologetics in his years of studying religion and in his wife\u2019s own RCIA."

Peterson really does seem to treat the religion more as a vehicle for his pre-held social than valuing the holy tradition itself. His recent debate with Destiny showcases all of his worst weaknesses. Constant conspiracy brain rot and \u201csymbolic\u201d references to scripture that just make it sound like gibberish to anyone outside the church."

It\u2019s like how people will often try to act as if politics is really just a matter of \u201cMy party is made up of the smart people and the other political party is made up of the dumb ones. If they were simply smarter, then they would view things the same way I do.\u201d"

Only being meek is not what will get you where you are supposed to be in this world. \n\nOf course our default setting in life should be to be innocent as a dove, to be meek. Yet we\u2019ll get eaten by the wolves if this is the only way we live our lifes. \n\nYou should also be able transform from a dove into a serpent. Like a serpent, you should choose your fights carefully. Serpents escape dangerous situation usually. They don\u2019t always escape it though, they themselves have the ability to be dangerous, but they know how to control it and do not spit around their venom everywhere. However, if they are cornered, they use their ability to be dangerous to protect themselves. \n\nSo the meek dove lets out the serpent from within, it\u2019s inner monster in Peterson\u2019s language, when it has to do it. We are sheep amongst wolves unfortunately, you actually deny reality if you don\u2019t realize that.\n\nAnd Jesus himself lives this out btw. By cleansing the temple for example, he acted like a serpent. The money changers stepped on what is holy and beautiful and true and he got angry and threw them out. \n\nWhen people deny the reality of sex, they are doing something similar like the money changers. And it\u2019s our job here to let out our serpents, like Jesus did in the temple and like Peterson and Matt Walsh do when the Gender people make our own temples a den thieves literally by doing what they do. Our bodies are holy temples to actually you know, and we shouldn\u2019t let this stuff happen, being meek here is not what we\u2019re called to do."

It\u2018s the sword you use like a serpent when someone is desecrating what is holy and when you fight for justice. He isn\u2019t talking about killing somebody or shedding blood.\n\nSo the sword he is talking about is akin to what we do when we are as wise as the serpents as Jesus commanded it to us. He didn\u2019t mean we should shed blood either obviously. If Peterson is calling us to using literally swords/weapons to take the lives of others, I won\u2019t listen to him, so don\u2019t be worried about that. \n\nHe might becomes that guy sometimes in the future, i hope not and think not though.

She can still walk, she even tries to work in the garden when no one is watching her. Her father was like her, he was a peasant with two cows and was always ill, but in his barn there was always a place for every person in need, every miserable wanderer. He used to share the same bed covers with them, as there wasn't any other choice, and the lices as a consequence. Rural Europe used to be very poor when America was already a flourishing country (I am talking about the period from the '20s to the '50s).\n\nIf you give yourself to God, this can very well happen. In any case you cease to be afraid of living. My grandmother lost a child when she was young, had many diseases, and is nonetheless always quiet and collected. She does not fear death. I have seen old people consumed by their egoism, losing their minds bit by bit, corroded by the ghosts they did not want to confront when there was a chance. if you enter old age with those ghosts, it will be so hard to manage. To me, that's hell, in a C.S Lewis fashion, while my grandmother already is in heaven, and there is only an inevitable step in front of her which won't be of any consequence at all. Of course, I hope she is going to stay with us for many years still. I would not be a Christian if it wasn't for her, because se showed me that living Christianly is possible, and that there are people who do so, no matter what the atheists said to placate their consciences - one of their favourite argument, when they do not try to manipulate history, is that Christianity is simply impossible. But since I was a child I have known that isn't true, because I had the perfect counterargument under my very eyes."

Basically, this interpretation asserts that the 120 years statement refers to the number of years God would allow humanity to live on earth before the judgement of the flood, and I would say it gives pretty solid reasoning, given that several fathers after that verse are said to have lived several hundred years. On the other hand, I suppose you could presumably still read it like God declaring that man's life would *eventually* be limited to just 120 years each, but at that point you are already allowing several exceptions in Scripture."

It is the inspired word of God. \n\nWhat you have mentioned is a common misconception about mosaic law (which if I may add Christians do not follow as it was done away with in the new covenant) and it\u2019s purpose in the Bible. When reading Exodus and Leviticus people always point to the these laws as evidence that God is unjust or evil. However, one must consider that in the fallen world, at this time, slavery was not only common but a established and normal aspect of society. \n\nPeople always skip over the part of the scriptures that call for the Israelites to treat their slaves with greater dignity than the other nations. These laws were not meant to be perfect, they were meant to reshape the society to a point that it could be reestablished under the perfect moral law of Christ. \n\nYou will not find the Catholic Church, nor any other proper Christian, claiming we should follow Mosaic law, or using it to justify slavery, etc. \n\nWe are not meant to follow these laws, only to understand them and their role in salvation history, that is why they are in the Bible and why there is truth revealed in them."

                "content": "Hi there folks, sorry I was busy working! My story is pretty short and the same as the one in the title. Months ago I was diagnosed with a brain tumour. I had heightened levels of hormones that were (and still are, as I heal) wrecking havoc on my life. My doctor ruled out any idiopathic causes, medication, lifestyle, etc., and a further blood test confirmed that I did indeed have a brain tumour. The wait-list for the MRI was incredibly long, as the healthcare system in my country is a mess at the moment. After finally getting an appointment, it was cancelled due to covid, and I eventually had to go for a private MRI, which was very costly and not covered by my insurance. Thankfully my family helped with the costs, as this whole thing has been very costly and I'm a young engaged man who is still in school and not making much money; I'm also trying to save up for my marriage which I know will be costly.\n\nI waited anxiously, eating ramen (student budgets lol), and praying hard. Every day I wore my Pope Pious XII medal around my neck, did novenas, and asked him to pray for me. My other patrons at this time were the Holy Family and St. Christopher, who I ask daily to help me cross the rivers of this life, just as he did with Christ.\n\nI got the results back, and was awe-struck. My doctor was incredibly confused. There are all signs pointing to the tumour having just... disappeared. I'm still in the healing process and now I need to work with an endocrinologist to 'heal up' and get myself back to baseline, but I was overjoyed. My Doctor didn't understand at all, as there we had ruled out everything else. The tumour just.. disappeared, left my pituitary gland, with no surgery, medication, or even major dietary changes. This isn't, to me, a case of \"mind over matter\", but rather a case of prayer, faith, and trusting in God and the Saints to help see me through. I also feel a tremendous amount of guilt, as one of my best friends passed away a few years ago at the age of 21 years of age from brain cancer. I wonder why it was so easy for him, but not for me, and I like to think he's looking over me. He was a brother in Christ, and such an incredible, innocent, and pure young man that I just know he's praying for me up there.\n\nThe road from here will still be long. The treatment will still be expensive to help me heal, but this most major of hurdles has just... disappeared. I know that now my funds will be going towards it, but not having to pay for the even more expensive tumour medication or neurosurgery is such a weight off my back. God bless you all."

Normally I wear an old brass cross with St. Christopher on one side and the Holy Family on the other, and I found this one in an old altoids tin that I had stashed in a drawer the day I got my diagnosis, so I said a Novena and added it to my necklace.

However, it does not advocate for strong central control over all aspects of life, nor does it promote a complete rejection of external help, making it more aligned with libertarian values than a hard authoritarian stance.",
        "left_to_right_rating": "Based on the content and tone of the post, I would rate it as 8, leaning towards the right side of the spectrum. The post expresses gratitude and devotion to Pope Pius XII, which may be seen as a conservative or traditionalist viewpoint. Additionally, the author's emphasis on personal faith, prayer, and the intercession of saints in overcoming their illness aligns with more conservative Christian perspectives. However, there is no explicit advocacy for radical social change, authoritarianism, or nationalism, so it does not lean towards the far right (-10). The overall tone is one of hope, gratitude, and personal experience, rather than ideological or political posturing, which suggests a more moderate or light-right position (4-6)."

In big secular cities like Zagreb, I'd say the majority are more on the apathetic side, true anti-Catholics are a minority even there.

The people here, at least in the small-ish town i live in but I've heard that it's not so different in other ones too, are backwards and judging. Very visible in the muslim population, they basically act like they're in the middle ages, but visible in christians too. \n\nMajority of people my age are the \"gaser\" kind if you know what that term refers to, basically same as the Russian gopnik i think. I swim strongly against that current in both style (I'm heavy into dark academia and old money, and also have long hair) and don't listen to trap music and i kid you not I've been made fun of on the bus station basically the whole year since i adopted my style. I don't really care about what they think, i hang out  with a crowd that also doesn't like it, but it's still annoying, especially since that kind of people for whom getting black out drunk is fun are a majority in my age group. The old people are mostly going center-far right politically but tend to be nice and polite. \n\nAnd no i would not want to live in istria, not for the politics but because I'm awful with handling heat xD"

My best friend is bosniak and looking at her family's attitudes on things always shocks me, it feels like they're in the middle ages. For Serbs it's mostly similar thought people from Vojvodina are the nicest people you'll meet in this world. As a friend i have from there once said \"the more you go south the closer you're to cavemen\". It's interesting that you can trace the whole cultural split to rome deciding to split itself into two halves at the Drina.\n\nQuestion, are you also a big fan of Austria-Hungary and wish that Franz Ferdinand was not assassinated as he wanted to reform the empire into a federation? I tend to find that that and the idea of \"central europeaness\" are somehwat connected lol (I'm a eurofederalist so i logically hold this opinion but i want to see what about you)"

What the statistics say is certainly not the reality of big cities like Zagreb.\n\nThings start to make sense, however, as you drive further from the big cities (Croatia is one of the least urbanized European countries, so this does matter). People outside the metro areas have a much stronger attachment to the Catholic Church, especially in the parts of the country torn by the Yugoslav wars. There are places where this attachment is so strong that divorce is virtually unexistent. And abortions, even if de jure legal, are almost impossible for women to get if they don't live in a big city. \n\nI understand your concerns, though. Sometimes things can feel as if the kind of people I'm talking about didn't exist. But they do. You simply aren't likely to meet them if you walk around Zagrebite college bubbles where what matters most is to be like \"the advanced West\". Neither if you navigate around Internet spaces, you will mostly meet lonely, terminally online people isolated from everybody in those, who again mainly come from the cities. None of these two groups (if they are even two groups lol) are even close to being representative of the Croatian population."

Pope Benedict XIII in the 1720s was the principal consecrator of dozens and dozens of bishops who were sent around the world, and whose own chains of principal consecration now cover over 90% of all Latin bishops.  But eight links back from Benedict was Cardinal Rebiba in 1541, whose records were destroyed in a fire.  We know Rebiba wasn't an impostor bishop, and that he was *probably* ordained by Pope Paul IV, but we just don't know for sure who was his principal consecrator."

Still, if I have never felt him (or have compelled by him to get past rationality). Even one time. Its a dilemma between the church on one side, and every other institution or system I've ever experienced on the other. If I am not divinely compelled, how am I supposed to trust the church over other institutions, even ones that I love dearly, when even the ones that have helped my life the most, I still do not and can not give blind trust.

Maybe the sin happened long ago, for example, and the person died since then. Maybe the person doesn't want to see you ever again. There are all kinds of possible reasons. So some additional, universal mechanism is needed.\n\nBut you should also apologize to the community, i.e. to God's people. If you claim to be a Christian and you sin, you wound that community. You owe the Church, as God's people, an apology as well. Confession allows for that to happen, by saying you are sorry to an authorized representative of God's people.\n\nJesus gave his apostles the power to forgive sins. That power has been transmitted to their successors, the bishops (and by extension, the priests). He also taught us that our forgiveness from our Father in heaven is tied to our mutual forgiveness on earth. In other words, God wants us to be forgiving each other, and to be asking for that forgiveness. So yes, we need priests in this very special ministry. We don't take the place of God, we are working for God when we do this."

        "selftext": "Too many people here believe that all religions lead to God. You cannot believe this as an orthodox Catholic. Here is an infallible creed put forth by the magisterium of the Catholic Church in order to defend the deposit of faith:\n\n\nWhosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the Catholic Faith. Which Faith except everyone do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly. And the Catholic Faith is this, that we worship one God in Trinity and Trinity in Unity. Neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Substance. For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Ghost. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Ghost is all One, the Glory Equal, the Majesty Co-Eternal. Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Ghost. The Father Uncreate, the Son Uncreate, and the Holy Ghost Uncreate. The Father Incomprehensible, the Son Incomprehensible, and the Holy Ghost Incomprehensible. The Father Eternal, the Son Eternal, and the Holy Ghost Eternal and yet they are not Three Eternals but One Eternal. As also there are not Three Uncreated, nor Three Incomprehensibles, but One Uncreated, and One Incomprehensible. So likewise the Father is Almighty, the Son Almighty, and the Holy Ghost Almighty. And yet they are not Three Almighties but One Almighty. So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God. And yet they are not Three Gods, but One God. So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Ghost Lord. And yet not Three Lords but One Lord. For, like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge every Person by Himself to be God and Lord, so are we forbidden by the Catholic Religion to say, there be Three Gods or Three Lords. The Father is made of none, neither created, nor begotten. The Son is of the Father alone; not made, nor created, but begotten. The Holy Ghost is of the Father, and of the Son neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.\n\nSo there is One Father, not Three Fathers; one Son, not Three Sons; One Holy Ghost, not Three Holy Ghosts. And in this Trinity none is afore or after Other, None is greater or less than Another, but the whole Three Persons are Co-eternal together, and Co-equal. So that in all things, as is aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity, is to be worshipped. He therefore that will be saved, must thus think of the Trinity.\n\nFurthermore, it is necessary to everlasting Salvation, that he also believe rightly the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. For the right Faith is, that we believe and confess, that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man.\n\nGod, of the substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds; and Man, of the substance of His mother, born into the world. Perfect God and Perfect Man, of a reasonable Soul and human Flesh subsisting. Equal to the Father as touching His Godhead, and inferior to the Father as touching His Manhood. Who, although He be God and Man, yet He is not two, but One Christ. One, not by conversion of the Godhead into Flesh, but by taking of the Manhood into God. One altogether, not by confusion of substance, but by Unity of Person. For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one Man, so God and Man is one Christ. Who suffered for our salvation, descended into Hell, rose again the third day from the dead. He ascended into Heaven, He sitteth on the right hand of the Father, God Almighty, from whence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies, and shall give account for their own works. And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting, and they that have done evil into everlasting fire. This is the Catholic Faith, which except a man believe faithfully and firmly, he cannot be saved. - Athanasian Creed \n\nThe worship of demons, whether it be in Hinduism or some other false paganism, will never lead you to God. The denial of Christ's divinity, whether it be in Talmudic Judaism, or Islam, will never lead you to God. Only the Catholic faith established by Jesus Christ, whole and entire, can lead you to salvation. ",

Thus, the Church considers all goodness and truth found in these religions as \"a preparation for the Gospel and given by him who enlightens all men that they may at length have life.\"\n\n...and conflating it with the idea that \"all religions are good\" or \"all religions are pathways to arrive at God\" or \"all religions lead to salvation\". Confusing speech compounds this error in some folks and that is a problem to manage. Btw, you say \"too many here believe that all religions lead to God\", I don't think it's very common at all on this subreddit, but would suppose even a little is too many.\n\nYou can at once appreciate elements of goodness and truth in a false religion and not believe they are saving religions. You don't even need to think that all religions have elements of truth and goodness; the Catholic doctrine only says that any *found* in them are of course good and true (not that all will have them)."

I evaluated it through a few hours of introspection, trying to find an angle that could discredit its ocean of grace. \n\nIt cemented my faith intrinsically into my very being. God is *there*, it is *truth*, its revelatory throughout creation and through us all, it is *beyond us*, its wants are *definable with human reason*, and it *wants me to emulate its love toward me, the created, to His creation -- toward others, in the best capacity I have*. \n\nThen, through further self-reflection, research into the common faiths, I found the Church.

                "content": "1. Firstly this doctrine is exclusionary and paints the universal God as an unloving God who casts to hell those who know him not. It is blasphemy on God's name.\n2. Secondly it boxes Catholicism in as a religion *antagonistic* to other religions which contain nomian teachings, thus making Catholicism antinomianism. This aligns it with Capital/s in seeking the dissolution of nomian beliefs and transcendant meaning.\n\n3. Thirdly Christ said Blessed are the peacemakers and Those who are not against us are for us. Through the lens of Judaism, we understand this as the level of the Meshulam or basic Ger, who is inherently Nomian and thus carries out the Noahide law of Acts 15 (theft was punished severely in Roman times) without necessarily acknowledging the Word of God who was revealed at Mount Sinai. Thus they may receive salvation through Good deeds.\n4. Catholics thus need to recognise that as we recognise the incarnate Word of God in the form of Christ Jesus and his teachings, believing in His revelation is sufficient for our salvation *provided* we demonstrate the orthopraxy necessary for belief that Christ demands, however we should not go around encouraging anti nomian behaviour for those whom it is very difficult to believe (and thus rob their means for salvation).\n6. Micah 4:5 says all nations will come with their name for God and we will come with ours [in the messianic age], and that weapons will be beaten into plowshares. That Christ is the only mediator between God and man [Hebrews] and the one who takes *all* our prayers to the Father even those who accepted him as a stranger is inherent in this understanding. May this come speedily in our time. Amen."

The statement was made in Singapore and what are the rules about talking about religion in Singapore? Did anyone ask themselves that question? I believe they have strict rules there...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. If you are talking to a crowd composed of different religions, if you are there to unite people, be in harmony and approach them peacefully, show the gates of Catholic Church as open to them and welcome other people,  \n\n\n\n\n\nwhich is better?  be hostile and talk to them in a mocking, bad way, and hammer in their heads outright that their religion wrong? \n\n\n\n\n\nor be charitable and compassionate to people of different religions who believed in good faith in regards to their religion? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. I recall Saint Paul the apostle when he went to Greece I think and in Greece as we know it there are several Gods the people there are worshipping...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid Saint Paul mock them for worshipping the wrong God? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSAINT PAUL COMMENDED THE PEOPLE FOR BEING RELIGIOUS OR ALONG THOSE LINES AND PROCEEDED TO TEACH THE GOSPEL, REDIRECT THEM TO THE RIGHT PATH, THE RIGHT RELIGION\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Pope Francis said \"There is only one God\"  as per the transcript available on the Vatican Website \n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2024/september/documents/20240913-singapore-giovani.html#:~:text=All%20religions%20are%20paths%20to,more%20important%20than%20yours!%E2%80%9D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nso there is no conflict and I believe the Gods of other religions is not the one true God that we Catholics worship \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSO IT MEANS Pope Francis means something else when he said those few lines that were misunderstood \n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us pray for the people in general and pray for the Pope against people who attack him, people who attack the church, people who twist his words, people who purposely misunderstand his statements to support their agenda, people who do not bother making their thorough research before making a conclusion...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us pray for the Pope's protection"

As 843(and 845) say in the CCC the goodness and truths from other religions act to prepare individuals in other faiths to come to God.\n\n\nYou, you can absolutely within reason say that the good elements of other religions \"lead to God\" in the sense that the True elements of their faith prepares them for enlightenment and eventual conversion to Catholicism.\n\n\nBut this doesn't give a free pass to all religions. The CCC also says (845) that we are specifically called to the Church of God's Son (Christianity), other religions are Mans failed attempts to rationalize the Truth.

                "author": "CatholicKnight-136",
                "content": "\nPope Francis delights people worldwide, as we saw in his recent visit to East Asia and Oceania.\nHe also drives people crazy worldwide, and we saw that, too, for instance when\u00a0he said: \u201cAll religions are paths to God. I will use an analogy, they are like different languages that express the divine.\u201d\nThis alarmed many Catholics who believe, with the Catechism, that, \u201cAll salvation comes from Christ the Head through the Church which is his Body.\u201d They worried that the Pope himself was saying otherwise. He\u2019s not.\nI wrote a whole book about the need to be clear about\u00a0What Pope Francis Really Said.\u00a0The book\u00a0came to Audible\u00a0last September and\u00a0an article I wrote\u00a0referencing it attracted 20,000 readers after Pope Francis\u00a0spoke on 60 Minutes.\nAs I say in the book, there are three simple steps Catholics can take when they are troubled by what the Pope said.\nFirst: Double check the Catechism.\nOften, the \u201ctroubling\u201d things Pope Francis says are just paraphrases of the Catechism.\nWhat I quoted above about salvation is from\u00a0No. 846\u00a0of the Catechism. What comes right before it and right after it are also important.\nRight before it, the Church\u00a0teaches\u00a0about truth in other faiths, and says about Muslims: \u201ctogether with us they adore the one, merciful God, mankind\u2019s judge on the last day.\u201d\nRight after it, the Catechism teaches that \u201cThose who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or his Church, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart and, moved by grace, try in their actions do his will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience \u2014\u00a0 those too may achieve eternal salvation.\u201d\nThink of it this way: When we die, every one of us \u2014 each Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist \u2014 will face Jesus Christ, our king and judge. Some of us will embrace him; others will flee him.\nMuslims may see in him the one God they love, or they may stick to what their religion gets wrong about God \u2014 the impossibility of the incarnation, for starters \u2014 and flee. Hindus may follow what their religion gets right about transcendence or what it gets wrong about reincarnation,\u00a0and so on.\nIf any is saved, it will be through Christ, and their conformity to the conscience placed in them through him. If any is lost, it will be by rejecting Christ, and the conscience he gave them.\nSecond: After checking the Catechism, check the context.\nIt\u2019s always helpful to read the actual words of the Pope, which are available with a little digging, and not just a reporter\u2019s account.\nWhen the Pope says something in a magisterial document defining what Catholics believe, then the charism of\u00a0papal infallibility\u00a0comes into play and Catholics must give the \u201cobedience of faith.\u201d But when the Pope says something in an informal setting, there is no expectation of infallibility.\nThese remarks\u00a0were a impromptu question-and-answer session with young people of various religions\u00a0(pictured above). Singapore has only a small percentage of Catholics. The Pope was not trying to give\u00a0Catholics\u00a0the final word on the Church\u2019s teaching; he was giving\u00a0non-Catholics\u00a0a\u00a0first\u00a0word on the Church\u2019s teaching.\nAt the same time, Catholics give \u201creligious assent\u201d even to non-magisterial statements the pope makes, when he is trying to help us understand revelation better. That means his words are something we should pay attention to.\nIn this case, Pope Francis is showing us that, when it comes to sharing the faith with non-believers, we should stress first what they get\u00a0right,\u00a0not what they get\u00a0wrong.\u00a0Jesus himself did this with the\u00a0woman at the well, making sure to also stress that he is the one salvation. Jesus also stressed the holiness of other faiths in the\u00a0Parable of the Good Samaritan.\nThird: Follow the Pope, adding whatever details of the faith you think are important.\nLast, if you think that the Pope left something out or said something unclearly, then maybe the Holy Spirit is urging you to action. Go and do what the Pope did: Encounter people who don\u2019t know Jesus Christ, and share your love of Christ with them, adding the teachings of the Church you think he missed.\nCatholics have \u201cthe obligation and the right to evangelize all,\u201d as the Catechism\u00a0puts it\u00a0\u2014 or, as Pope Francis said, \u201cThere is a kind of preaching which falls to each of us as a daily responsibility. It has to do with bringing the Gospel to the people we meet, whether they be our neighbors or complete strangers\u201d (No. 127).\nHe said that in\u00a0The Joy of Evangelization\u00a0 and followed it up by saying words\u00a0very relevant to his remarks in Singapore.\n\u201cIf a text was written to console, it should not be used to correct errors; if it was written as an exhortation, it should not be employed to teach doctrine; if it was written to teach something about God, it should not be used to expound various theological opinions\u201d (No. 147).\nPope Francis\u2019s Singapore address was meant to console. Follow it up with texts meant to teach. In this case, maybe:\nDominus Iesus,\u00a0by Cardinal Ratzinger and promulgated by St. John Paul II in 2000.\nNotification Dubois,\u00a0which nicely summarizes the main points of\u00a0Dominus Iesus\u00a0from 2001.\n\u201cThe Church and Non-Christians\u201d from the Catechism.\nOf course, I also think you should read (or\u00a0listen to)\u00a0What Pope Francis Really Said,\u00a0but I\u2019m biased."

I am an atheist so I can't explicitly thank God for His awesome and beautiful creation - but I feel that urge. So, then, is the coffee and the view a path to God? Well, in some way it is. But the problem is the language of 'path'. Because path implies that it's a, well, a path, a road, a way that I can continue walking down to get to my destination. In that sense - is the coffee a path to God? Can I drink more coffee, join coffee roasting clubs, etc. and then get closer to God - no I cannot. So in what sense is it a path if I only take 1 step on it before having to turn down another path?\n\nI would rather use the language of preparation, as does the CCC cited above. The coffee, the view, prepares me to accept the Gospel of Christ. There is only one path that saves - and that is Jesus Christ and the Church that He founded - the Catholic Church. All other religions are but preparations for this path.\n\nPersonally, I lump all other religions with things like: studying nature or ancient philosophy, exercise, hobbies, spending time with friends, etc. These are all things that prepare us and predispose us for the Gospel. They soften us to receive His grace.\n\nSo I have to agree with the statement, 'Only one religion leads to God'. I can add the statement 'All other faiths besides the Catholic faith prepare us for God and His Church'. But here 'all other faiths' is in the same bucket as art, philosophy, maths etc. But of course other faiths come with the added bonus of being headed by demons. :)"

                "content": "Again you\u2019te clearly on an agenda against pope francis. He said there\u2019s one god .\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis delights people worldwide, as we saw in his recent visit to East Asia and Oceania.\nHe also drives people crazy worldwide, and we saw that, too, for instance when\u00a0he said: \u201cAll religions are paths to God. I will use an analogy, they are like different languages that express the divine.\u201d\nThis alarmed many Catholics who believe, with the Catechism, that, \u201cAll salvation comes from Christ the Head through the Church which is his Body.\u201d They worried that the Pope himself was saying otherwise. He\u2019s not.\nI wrote a whole book about the need to be clear about\u00a0What Pope Francis Really Said.\u00a0The book\u00a0came to Audible\u00a0last September and\u00a0an article I wrote\u00a0referencing it attracted 20,000 readers after Pope Francis\u00a0spoke on 60 Minutes.\nAs I say in the book, there are three simple steps Catholics can take when they are troubled by what the Pope said.\nFirst: Double check the Catechism.\nOften, the \u201ctroubling\u201d things Pope Francis says are just paraphrases of the Catechism.\nWhat I quoted above about salvation is from\u00a0No. 846\u00a0of the Catechism. What comes right before it and right after it are also important.\nRight before it, the Church\u00a0teaches\u00a0about truth in other faiths, and says about Muslims: \u201ctogether with us they adore the one, merciful God, mankind\u2019s judge on the last day.\u201d\nRight after it, the Catechism teaches that \u201cThose who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or his Church, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart and, moved by grace, try in their actions do his will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience \u2014\u00a0 those too may achieve eternal salvation.\u201d\nThink of it this way: When we die, every one of us \u2014 each Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist \u2014 will face Jesus Christ, our king and judge. Some of us will embrace him; others will flee him.\nMuslims may see in him the one God they love, or they may stick to what their religion gets wrong about God \u2014 the impossibility of the incarnation, for starters \u2014 and flee. Hindus may follow what their religion gets right about transcendence or what it gets wrong about reincarnation,\u00a0and so on.\nIf any is saved, it will be through Christ, and their conformity to the conscience placed in them through him. If any is lost, it will be by rejecting Christ, and the conscience he gave them.\nSecond: After checking the Catechism, check the context.\nIt\u2019s always helpful to read the actual words of the Pope, which are available with a little digging, and not just a reporter\u2019s account.\nWhen the Pope says something in a magisterial document defining what Catholics believe, then the charism of\u00a0papal infallibility\u00a0comes into play and Catholics must give the \u201cobedience of faith.\u201d But when the Pope says something in an informal setting, there is no expectation of infallibility.\nThese remarks\u00a0were a impromptu question-and-answer session with young people of various religions\u00a0(pictured above). Singapore has only a small percentage of Catholics. The Pope was not trying to give\u00a0Catholics\u00a0the final word on the Church\u2019s teaching; he was giving\u00a0non-Catholics\u00a0a\u00a0first\u00a0word on the Church\u2019s teaching.\nAt the same time, Catholics give \u201creligious assent\u201d even to non-magisterial statements the pope makes, when he is trying to help us understand revelation better. That means his words are something we should pay attention to.\nIn this case, Pope Francis is showing us that, when it comes to sharing the faith with non-believers, we should stress first what they get\u00a0right,\u00a0not what they get\u00a0wrong.\u00a0Jesus himself did this with the\u00a0woman at the well, making sure to also stress that he is the one salvation. Jesus also stressed the holiness of other faiths in the\u00a0Parable of the Good Samaritan.\nThird: Follow the Pope, adding whatever details of the faith you think are important.\nLast, if you think that the Pope left something out or said something unclearly, then maybe the Holy Spirit is urging you to action. Go and do what the Pope did: Encounter people who don\u2019t know Jesus Christ, and share your love of Christ with them, adding the teachings of the Church you think he missed.\nCatholics have \u201cthe obligation and the right to evangelize all,\u201d as the Catechism\u00a0puts it\u00a0\u2014 or, as Pope Francis said, \u201cThere is a kind of preaching which falls to each of us as a daily responsibility. It has to do with bringing the Gospel to the people we meet, whether they be our neighbors or complete strangers\u201d (No. 127).\nHe said that in\u00a0The Joy of Evangelization\u00a0 and followed it up by saying words\u00a0very relevant to his remarks in Singapore.\n\u201cIf a text was written to console, it should not be used to correct errors; if it was written as an exhortation, it should not be employed to teach doctrine; if it was written to teach something about God, it should not be used to expound various theological opinions\u201d (No. 147).\nPope Francis\u2019s Singapore address was meant to console. Follow it up with texts meant to teach. In this case, maybe:\nDominus Iesus,\u00a0by Cardinal Ratzinger and promulgated by St. John Paul II in 2000.\nNotification Dubois,\u00a0which nicely summarizes the main points of\u00a0Dominus Iesus\u00a0from 2001.\n\u201cThe Church and Non-Christians\u201d from the Catechism.\nOf course, I also think you should read (or\u00a0listen to)\u00a0What Pope Francis Really Said,\u00a0but I\u2019m biased."

(Which, would ultimately lead to Catholicism)\n\nLet's take a concrete example, say Islam. Islam goes part of the way towards God, then it diverges from the straight and narrow. But insofar as Islam has led you towards God, it is really the light of natural reason which leads you towards God, not Islam as such. Islam is a road that paves itself off from the straight and narrow. When you arrive at that fork, you may choose to continue down the straight and narrow and become closer to God, or you may choose to divert your path and take the path of Islam.\n\nIslam will lead you away from God, not towards Him. The truth contained in Islam is just a portion of whatever truth is in Catholicism, mixed in with a bunch of lies. The \"road\" goes towards God insofar as it contains those truths, but for that portion of the journey, the \"road of Islam\" is just the straight and narrow way. You get off of the straight and narrow the moment you accept false Islamic tenets."

Re-formulated positively, it means that all salvation comes from Christ the Head through the Church which is his Body:\n\n>Basing itself on Scripture and Tradition, the Council teaches that the Church, a pilgrim now on earth, is necessary for salvation: the one Christ is the mediator and the way of salvation; he is present to us in his body which is the Church. He himself explicitly asserted the necessity of faith and Baptism, and thereby affirmed at the same time the necessity of the Church which men enter through Baptism as through a door. **Hence they could not be saved who, knowing that the Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God through Christ, would refuse either to enter it or to remain in it.**\n\n>847 This affirmation is not aimed at those who, through no fault of their own, do not know Christ and his Church:\n\n>Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or his Church, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and, moved by grace, try in their actions to do his will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too may achieve eternal salvation.\n\n>848 \u201cAlthough in ways known to himself God can lead those who, through no fault of their own, are ignorant of the Gospel, to that faith without which it is impossible to please him, **the Church still has the obligation and also the sacred right to evangelize all men.\u201d**"

God's purpose was rather to reveal himself to us as a personal God who seeks friendship with us. Scripture tells us the story of how God acted in history and prepared the world for the ultimate revelation of Jesus Christ.\n\nSecond, and nevertheless, God as he reveals himself in the scriptures does not contradict what can be known about God by reason alone. Divine revelation and human reason work hand in hand to give us the full picture of who God is \u2014 reason supporting what God himself reveals to us.\n\nThird, we do in fact learn in the scriptures many attributes of God that agree with what is known by reason \u2014 for example, that God is uncreated, he's existed from all eternity, everything that exists was created by him, he does not change, he holds all things in existence at every moment they exist, he's the source of all being, he loves everything he has made, he is the source of goodness, he is the only God, he is eternally blessed and happy, he orders the universe, he is not made of matter, he is truth itself, he is life itself, he is simple, he is perfect, he exercises providence over all things, he is in all things, he is the final end of all things, and more. (Note that many of these ideas are found in the Old Testament as well as the New and can't be written off merely as Paul \"stealing\" Greek thought.)\n\n>Also why can't Zeus be \"being itself\" Too?\n\nIn one sense, he could be. If by \"Zeus\" what we mean is God, the uncreated and almighty creator of the world, who exists eternally and is unchanging, pure actuality, being itself, etc. If we mean to name that when we say \"Zeus,\" then Zeus can work as his name.\n\nThe Zeus we know in Greek mythology and religion does not fit that description, however. For starters, he is the son of another god and came into existence. He also has a body, changes, married another god and has divine children, exists in time, suffers from lack and want, has passions, and is one among many gods.\n\nA believer in ancient Greek religion could rise above the myths of his religion and, using philosophy, come to understand that there must be one uncreated and almighty God. He could have called him Zeus and reasoned that all of the less worthy characteristics attributed to Zeus must be anthropomorphisms added to him over time. That is essentially what the Platonists and Stoics did, coming to a more perfect belief in God by way of religious belief, elevated by reason.\n\n>So I don't see how your God is different from Zeus in any way, shape of form.\n\nWell, I've now laid out various ways they differ. See what you think."

After all, *you* came *here*, mocked us with sarcasm, and then claimed that you had genuine questions for me after I countered your irony with a bit of earnest belief. Your questions don't seem so genuine when my responses don't get real consideration, or really appear to register with you at all, but instead just trigger more stock objections.\n\nYou simply assert that belief in God is not reasonable and note that, therefore, our conversation is going nowhere. But if you discovered that this assumption of yours was wrong, do you think you'd be open to changing your beliefs? A lot of people who repeat the claim \"there's no evidence that God exists\" don't actually know the arguments \u2014 I have found that to be the case shockingly often, in fact.\n\nSome who take the time to thoughtfully consider arguments for God's existence end up changing their mind, and they become theists if not believers. If the case against belief was as open-and-shut as invoking sky Daddy or calling scripture fairy tales, in my opinion that sort of thing wouldn't happen."

She is withdrawn from the family and the care of her children, to be thrust instead into public life and collective production under the same conditions as man. The care of home and children then devolves upon the collectivity. Finally, the right of education is denied to parents, for it is conceived as the exclusive prerogative of the community, in whose name and by whose mandate alone parents may exercise this right.\""

It is a focal point in the movement for women's rights. After the Socialist Party of America organized a Women's Day in New York City on February 28, 1909, German delegates Clara Zetkin, K\u00e4te Duncker and others proposed at the 1910 International Socialist Woman's Conference that \"a special Women's Day\" be organized annually. After women gained suffrage in Soviet Russia in 1917, March 8 became a national holiday there. The day was then predominantly celebrated by the socialist movement and communist countries until it was adopted by the feminist movement in about 1967. The United Nations began celebrating the day in 1977. -- Wikipedia\n\nLooks like OP is trying to Christianize a holy day created by socialists trying to make women compete with men."

And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.\n\nActs 4:32-\n> ^32 Now the company of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had everything in common. ^33 And with great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. ^34 There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of what was sold ^35 and laid it at the apostles\u2019 feet; and distribution was made to each as any had need. ^36 Thus Joseph who was surnamed by the apostles Barnabas (which means, Son of encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus, ^37 sold a field which belonged to him, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles\u2019 feet.\n\nOne thing you should notice in these passages, is that the giving was a voluntary outgrowth of charity of those in the church, and that the possessions were then given to the apostles, those given divine authority by Christ, for distribution. While one can certainly see a faint resemblance to communism, it is not. Communism, everywhere it has attempted to be implemented, involves a secular or even atheistic government taking property at point of gun, killing it's resistance.

According to this doctrine there is in the world only one reality, matter, the blind forces of which evolve into plant, animal and man. Even human society is nothing but a phenomenon and form of matter, evolving in the same way. By a law of inexorable necessity and through a perpetual conflict of forces, matter moves towards the final synthesis of a classless society. In such a doctrine, as is evident, there is no room for the idea of God; there is no difference between matter and spirit, between soul and body; there is neither survival of the soul after death nor any hope in a future life. Insisting on the dialectical aspect of their materialism, the Communists claim that the conflict which carries the world towards its final synthesis can be accelerated by man. Hence they endeavor to sharpen the antagonisms which arise between the various classes of society. Thus the class struggle with its consequent violent hate and destruction takes on the aspects of a crusade for the progress of humanity. On the other hand, all other forces whatever, as long as they resist such systematic violence, must be annihilated as hostile to the human race."

Apart from comparitively recent shifts in economic policy a huge swathe of China's sociopolitical structure is very much Communist."

A person might be well known and seen as an extrodinarily holy figure in life, or they may not be well known in life, but after their death they become known.\n\nAlso, sometimes people find more inspiration in the life and easier to ask for the intercession of saints who lived a life more similar to them with the more common struggles they experienced.  \n\nGod doesn't demand a sameness of saints, nor does he say that only the flashy well known saints are worth of honor and veneration.  \n\nAlso to be beatified or canonized the person would have performed miracles so I don't really see why you're making an issue of this?"

In regards to drinking water - it is usually paid by water bills which seem to be enough to pay for the costs as far as I am able to find out.\nLibraries often live from membership fees, donations and research.\n\nAs for healthcare - this is quite an interesting subject because the free market doesn't work here as well as in other places. Your health is worth nothing to you while you are healthy and a lot when you are ill. It is in your interest to pay some kind of insurance so you can equalize the costs between variable states of health. From personal insurance, there is a small step to the collective insurance, as it benefits each and every individual to be in a society surrounded by healthy people that don't have a great fear of health misfortune.\n\nAs for education, in my opinion, it should be provided by employers as it is in their interest to have an educated workforce - in some cases, it is prudent to even for the state, taxes to pay particular education. I find it sad that apprenticeship has fallen out of practice."

Aside from the beautiful decorations my parish always puts up for Christmas, and the lovely Christmas carols we all sing beforehand, and just the overall joyous vibe, midnight mass is a very humbling experience to m. Its a great reminder that Christmas is not about the gifts or the feasts you indulge in, but about the birth of our newborn king, and a reminder that God himself became human, so that humanity might become more like God. Might be my favorite service of the year, 2nd only to Easter."

Plus, I see them as a very reasonable personal safety precaution that many people employ on a daily basis.\n\nNow, assault weapons... absolutely restrict the shit out of them. 3 month waiting periods, sanity checks, whatever, I don't think it's un-constitutional to do that. But the sad truth is that it really won't have much effect if any on commission of violent crimes with them.

My personal experience with firearms is that of learning gun safety, family bonding, hunting, and clay shooting.  In such a case, no other strong link exists.  Perhaps you were in the military and link guns with killing people -- or know someone who was hurt by firearms.  Or, maybe you have no experience with firearms and can only hold those views/links that others have presented to you.\n\nTo elaborate my point -- Yes, firearm fatalities occur.  However, automobile accident fatalities are much more common.  Heart disease is the #1 killer.  So, does seeing a priest driving a car or eating at McDonalds bring you the same kind of despair?  My ultimate (and respectful) point is -- if it does -- it would be a more logical link to hold.  If it doesn't, your own personal mental link and dislike for images of priests holding guns is skewed by your personal experiences or media consumption (as my views are colored by my own experiences), and not necessarily an objective reality or real danger/threat of violence.  So, try not to be too troubled by the image.  There are many wholesome and useful applications for guns -- even for priests. :)"

Let's start with\n\n>Legitimate defense != violent defense\n\nBecause I'm not quite sure you understand the legal qualifications set forth  by self-defense law in the US. I'm assuming we're talking about the US laws here. I really only care to defend US self-defense laws and consider other countries with less legal protections for self-defenders to be lacking respect for this aspect of human dignity. Further, someone who disagrees with lethal self-defense would have the most problems with US laws and the least problems with other countries, for example, in Europe where you can barely, if even, own pepper spray.\n\n[For a legal argument of \"self defense,\"](https://www.ajc.com/news/national/here-why-police-don-shoot-wound-the-case-deadly-force/IV4ohtIm6r8FaEMj78u1bO/) someone must argue they were defending themselves from a felony or serious bodily harm. [You can't \"shoot to kill\" if someone is going to violate you in either of those ways, you'll go straight to jail.](https://dailycaller.com/2016/09/24/ccw-weekend-if-you-have-to-shoot-shoot-to-stop-the-threat/) You must us an appropriate amount of force to end the threat; that is the same standard that police are held to. So, with a gun you *shoot to stop a threat* not shoot to kill. \n\nThat is exactly what JP II is saying in EV. You can't just shoot a guy because he picks a bar-fight with you before you even try to walk way or de-escalate. That would be morally illegitimate and happens to be legally illegitimate as well. *You can only use lethal force when legitimated by \"the need to render the aggressor incapable of causing harm\" in defense of \"another's life, the common good of the family or of the State.\"* **This adequately answers your previous comment--** \n\n>It really calls into question what the \u201cright\u201d time could be for violence if preventing deicide isn\u2019t it.\n\n**--with authoritative Magisterial teaching from a saint and pope** and you should admit that."

To then make the object of the act a human person who is God is to infinitely increase the gravity of the evil.\n\nObviously the circumstance of Christ\u2019s command is essential to the full moral analysis, which is why I was careful to speak in principle. But the poster who started this line of thought stated that the reason for the command was that it wasn\u2019t the right time\u2014which leads me back into my first comment, because if preventing the gravest possible evil from taking place wasn\u2019t enough to make it the right time to resort to violence (not just self-defense, though the two are usually conflated), what does that say about any other imaginable time where much lesser evils would be prevented?"

I also don\u2019t know why you brought up US law when the actual issue is morality for those under the new covenant.\n\nSo my question still stands, because it isn\u2019t actually answered by the fact that the Church allows for subjective culpability not to accrue in those limited instances where the aggressor\u2019s death is an unintended consequence of defense.\n\nThe Church allows the faithful much leeway in moral matters, not binding them to absolute perfection in their following Christ (cf the evangelical counsels, for example, or the Church\u2019s precepts); however, Christ *does* invite us to perfection, and it\u2019s seemingly only in this matter that such an invitation is not only declined but actively rejected in favor of the minimum needed to be good enough."

I used to think of ultra feminine trans woman alot when high. I exaggerate a lot, which is a for of  lying, and so on my point is we all fall short of God's word. All we can do is accept Jesus as our lord and savior and truly repent for our sins. No good deeds get us to heaven no matter how grand only the acceptance of Jeesus as our savior and repentance of our sins gets us in. Sorry if I came off as judgmental, not my intention at all.

For since in the time of the Old Testament not only did the Gentiles adore false gods but also very frequently the people of God turned to idols and strange gods, Jeremiah predicted the future, that in the time of the New Testament all men would know the one God, which we certainly see now to have been fulfilled. For the Gentiles have been converted to the faith, and also the Jews themselves and the Turks [i.e. Muslims], although they are impious, yet worship the one God.\n\nPope St. Gregory VII (In a letter to a Muslim Ruler):\n>Almighty God, who wishes that all should be saved and none lost, approves nothing in so much as that after loving Him one should love his fellow man, and that one should not do to others, what one does not want done to oneself. You and we owe this charity to ourselves especially because we believe in and confess one God, admittedly, in a different way, and daily praise and venerate him, the creator of the world and ruler of this world.\u2019\n\nCatechism of Pope St. Pius X\n\n>12 Q. Who are infidels?\n\n>A. Infidels are those who have not been baptised and do not believe in Jesus Christ, because they either believe in and worship false gods as idolaters do, or though admitting one true God, they do not believe in the Messiah, neither as already come in the Person of Jesus Christ, nor as to come; for instance, Mohammedans and the like.\n\n\\---\n\nFailure to understand the nature of God doesn't mean someone doesn't worship God. We can say they don't understand His nature. We can say they ascribe wrong actions to Him. We can say the rites through which they worship are incorrect and impious. But that doesn't necessarily mean that they don't worship God.\n\nTake for example Protestants. Do most of them understand that He is present in the Eucharist? Not at all; but that doesn't mean they worship a totally foreign God due to their ability to misunderstand and reject that. Not even in the height of the Counter-Reformation did our theologians accuse them of such."

Islam says it, scholars say it, schools and universities teach it, and the Vatican confirms it as other comments on here have quoted. To deny this is silly. To take it a step further and say they're the antichrist instead of simply misguided is just divisive and not helpful. It does not bring either side closer to God."

This is for two reasons: so that the priest does not touch anything with those fingers after touching them to Jesus because of the extreme divinity contained within the host, and so that no micro particles of the eucharist which may have stuck to the priests fingers get scattered around the altar and left there. The practice has been abrogated into the new mass, but many priests continue to do it regardless."

Holding the two fingers together is a practice to show that we will do what we can to not scatter it about. It is also why there is a linen placed below the sacred vessels on the altar. If you ever notice, the cloth is unfolded such that the creases go down toward the altar. This is done intentionally so that any particles that may fall will get caught in those valleys when the linen is folded (also done in a carefully particular way) to trap those particles for washing in the sacrarium. All small details for sure, but done for love and reverence of Our Lord."

If you were right in saying that this practice was actually abrogated in the OF, and not merely left out of the rubrics, then all of these priests would be committing an act of liturgical abuse every time they say Mass.\n\nI'm sorry I don't have a source, but I can't imagine that it was actually abrogated in the OF.  It must have merely been left out of the new rubrics."

Unless they have that role, they may do \"pastoral\" work (as do the some members of the laity, in a sense), but are not themselves considered pastors."

You need to be grounded in something that is bigger than yourself, and that foundation needs to be Jesus Christ the Lord in His mystical body on earth, the Church. Also, I would love to see where in the bible it actually says not to consider a building holy, because that would fly right in the face of Jesus himself whipping the money changers for turning the temple into a market place."

A few years ago I had a supernatural experience in which God told me to pray to him. From then on I have been a follower of Christ and was interested in joining the Catholic Church. 2 years in, I met my boyfriend at our protestant college and he happened to be Catholic. So, I started going to mass with him and never turned back. Most I learned about the Catholic faith came from sources online and then real experience in mass and adoration. Very thankful from where Christ has taken me throughout my life and he has truly redeemed it all."

For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel.\n\nPhilippians 2:19-22 (Saint Paul refers to his relationship with Timothy of that of a father and son in the spiritual sense during their missionary trips)\n\n>I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be cheered by news of you. For I have no one like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare. For they all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. But you know Timothy\u2019s proven worth, how as a son with a father he has served with me in the gospel.\n\nActs 7:2 (Saint Stephen calls the priests and bishops of the Council fathers as well as Abraham)\n\n>And Stephen said: \u201cBrothers and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,\n\nActs 22:1 (Saint Paul before the Pharisees)\n\n>\u201cBrothers and fathers, hear the defense that I now make before you.\u201d\n\nLuke 1:73\n\n>the oath that he swore to our father Abraham, to grant us\n\n---\n\n>\"And when you are praying, do not use meaningless repetition as the Gentiles do, for they suppose that they will be heard for their many words.\" Matthew 6:7 - Go on, say your hail marys with your pagan rosary beads and again go against the bible. \n\nYou're missing the context here, Christ is saying not to heap up empty praises to impress man. Just as he condemned fasting and almsgiving for man's pleasure and not Gods. The prohibition is not on repetitions. But on VAIN repetitions. If repetitions were vain then why would Christ, His Disciples, and all the other Apostles decide to quote and pray the Psalms - which, if repeated more than once in your life, lead to a \"vain\" repetition in your incorrect view?\n\n---\n\n>Enjoy worshipping your pedophile priest, a shame that got out really.\n\nTake some time to cool off. There are actual Protestant debaters out there. Scholarly ones who don't use ad hominem or strawmen. Who exactly do you think you're going to convince by insulting?"

I do not mean earthly days, which is the time it takes for Earth to rotate in its own axis, I want you to compare your own perception of an earthly day and think how long would it take for an eternal being to experience the same thing in His Own perspective. Now figure how a hebrew man from almost 4000 years ago, all tongue tied tried to describe this. Greeks could have said it took God 7 eons and that would be more accurate.

                "content": "> The bible itself contradicts itself many times so it is hard to follow and I dont believe any denomination is 'right' 100% in how they follow it.\n\nThe Bible says the Church is the \"Pillar and Foundation\" of truth (1 Timothy 3:5) - if the Pillar and Foundation of the truth is no totally correct in receiving, preserving, and conveying Christian divine revelation then something is seriously wrong.\n\n>The father point of yours I do get and understand just due to that fact. \n\nHuh? So you agree with your previous stance or what I said? Sorry. Bit confused.\n\n>Your points on repetition are weak though, to say the least. Saying a prayer more than once throughout your lifetime isnt the repetition I believe they are speaking of.\n\nBut who are you to determine the criteria of how long a Christian needs to wait until something can be prayed again?\n\n>Praying 15 sets of 10 consecutive hail marrys in a row is meaningless repetition.\n\nAnd the same logic applies above. What do you base your criteria on? How do you know you don't just see it as meaningless because you are personally ascribing no merit to it?\n\n>Again thats only two points as well, the bible also says bishops should be married and have children, speaks against latin mass (or any not in common tounge).\n\nThe context, time, and place is important for those verses. Saint Paul was speaking to Saint Timothy, and him alone, and giving Church Law to the Church in Ephesus at during the 1st century. It wasn't Church Law for all time - it was a disciplinary measure.\n\nAnd if you take that verse with such black and white meaning it falls apart. If a man is a bishop is required to get married? It says \"children\", plural... so someone can't be a bishop if they have 1 child? Only 2? \n\n>speaks against latin mass (or any not in common tounge).\n\nWhat verse are you referring to?\n\n>There's just so many flaws I find it hard to believe anyone could truly follow it especially given how corrupt the church has been. \n\nBecause the actions of individuals do not invalidate ones claim. It's like Galileo saying \"the earth revolves around the sun\" but his landlord says \"Galileo is a little shit and hasn't payed me rent in 2 months, therefore he is wrong, and the earth doesn't revolve around the sun\" - that's a non-sequitur argument. \"The priest did a bad thing therefore what the Church teaches regarding [topic] is wrong\" is an argument that is logically broken. It doesn't flow.\n\n>The point on the pedophiles wasnt an insult nor is it a strawman. It is a very real problem and the fact that it went all the way to the pope and still they were protected and sheltered is disgusting. That proves they care more about their image and getting money than what they actually teach. Pedophile priest would not be relocated when discovered if they actually cared. You have high ranking officials left and right getting caught. There's too many specifics to call that a straw man. \n\nNo, you said we *worship* our pedophile priest. Check back on what I quoted from you. That's a strawman. No one worships priests, save the High Priest Jesus Christ. No one wants pedophiles in our Church. It was a total strawman. No body worships the Pope, or priests, or the Blessed Virgin Mary, or an angel, or any sort of artistic images or statues. No one disagrees with you that pedophiles and their coverups need to be taken care of... yet, how does something like \"this bishop covered up for a pedo therefore their doctrine on infant baptism is false\" make any sense? The conclusion does not logically come from the premise.\n\n>You can't have someone who is essentially chosen by god saying and performing such deplorable actions.\n\nWho said the Popes are chosen by God?\n\n>You didn't bring up the burning of William Tyndale at all. I believe most of us would agree that it was a horrid decision.\n\nI don't speak on things I don't know of. Save this message.\n\n>Historically the catholic church has been filled with corruption and sin, do you think that just stopped?\n\nYeah, it's a refuge for sinners - not a museum of saints. Of course people have done bad things in the past. But your Protestantism is far worse. It's a heresy that sends people to hell, and it spreads. Pedophilia, greed, or whatever have you is not a spreadable disease.\n\nAnd hey, at least we *have* a history that can go back past the 1500s. As a Christian of supposedly \"no denomination\" what link do you actually have to the 1st century Church? Can you provide any records... archaelogical evidence... ordination lines of your pastors... *anything* that shows you are concretely connect to the 1st century Church? If not then you are a man-made \"church\" that erroneously thinks that if you pick up a Bible and follow it you're somehow connected to the bishops who ordained each other through the lay on hands in Acts. So I am interested in knowing: how can you prove to me you're part of the same Church Christ built in Matthew 16:18?"

All of Brant Pitre's works are wonderful. \n\nYou say you found too many discrepancies in the Bible, but in my own experience I found that every question I have had has had sound answers. In fact, I found that a lot of my questions had been answered hundreds of years ago or earlier. I used to be an athiest and then agnostic too, but as I learned more and more about the Church I started to realize how if any religion was true, it was Catholicism. Most of the thoughts I had that made me pretty anti-Catholic were based on ignorance and misinformation. (Also, please note my intent is not to offend you by implying that you are ignorant.)\n\nAs for \"why do you need to be connected to the first century church\", I don't believe that God would leave a 1500 year gap before the true church began.\n\nI agree that there are some christians that are more hateful than loving, often seen in cases like homosexuality, but that is not the fault of the Church. The Church teaches to love thy neighbor, the results of which may be interpreted as hate by some, but when done correctly is more loving than to let a person be damned. It is understandable to be upset about the corruption that has taken place throughout the Church's history, but the actions of people does not reflect on the Church herself. Maybe think of it like this. Just because Germany has had Hitler as a dictator and had many citizens joined him to commit despicable acts, it doesn't mean that everyone in Germany today should be judged for that.\n\nAlso, what text do you mean by \"the text was hidden for so long from the public and has changed so much\"?"

Granted I believe Christianity in general is largely used to sucker money out of the middle class. The catholic church literally sold forgiveness and relics both of which go against the bible and are horrible extortionate. I believe most agree that the Catholic church at least went through a period of horrible corruption, how can we know what they teach now is real? The text was hidden for so long from the public and has changed so much who knows what was changed to further the catholic agenda.\n\nif you want answers to your comments i'd recommend make a separate thread rather than bogging down this person's happy post parroting anti Catholic anecdotes that are often without context or exaggeration.  \n\nMake a separate post and people would be happy to debunk your claims."

I think 100% of the time, I\u2019ve had people reneg on their belief in science rather than give credit to Christianity.\n\nLeftism/ atheism supporters here in NorCal most of the time hate and deny science without even knowing it. New Atheism openly hated philosophy, now \u201cNew\u201d New Atheism is following through and openly denying science, and when you point to scientific arguments and identify them as such they will finally break and admit they disagree with and hate science. I have even seen them take the Greek model of the universe, which is no longer accepted in any fashion by modern science, without knowing it just so they can deny the universe had a beginning.\n\nThere is a great statement I believe from Vatican II: when God is forgotten, the creature becomes unintelligible. This is playing out in real-time quickly, and I believe it was Jordan Peterson (summarizing Nietzsche) who said the Christian worldview, in its pursuit of truth, accidentally cut the branch it was standing on.\n\nBut this is perfectly backwards. New Atheism\u2019s intellectual leaders openly detested philosophy (Lawrence Krauss, Dawkins, Neil Degrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, etc) making public statements as such. Now, without a pursuit of truth, we can\u2019t justify science in the limited worldview of the will to power. The next generation of atheists will not only detest philosophy (as they always have), but will shift their ire on science."

It is us humans who are fallen from that perfection, and thus why Jesus Christ the one true Son of God had to come and die for our sins and redeem us. If science agrees that the Universe has what they call \"the laws of physics\" they are conceding that there are laws by which all of reality must abide. What are laws if not something that is created? Created by who? What is creating if the Universe didn't exist yet? The laws of science began when the Universe did. So of course there must have been a creator to determine what those laws were going to be. Any deviation to the law and this Universe could not possibly exist as we know it. Everything had to be just perfect in order for your existance to be possible. So what am I saying? I am saying that the laws of science and the laws of God are of the same author: the creator of our Universe and reality. This is why we call Him Father, for He breathed reality into existance and gave us life through His Word. And even though we betrayed Him, he gave us His son, while we were yet sinners, so that whoever should believe in Him would have eternal life. Amen!"

He was a splendid example of someone who practiced science and religion seperately out of respect for both.\n\nAtheists who were against the theory either didn't understand Lema\u00eetre's position, or perhaps they were arguing against religious people who assumed the theory was some kind of slam-dunk victory for religious creationism narratives.\n\nNot to mention that there is no theory which claims that time had a beginning.

Had that occurred, a strong argument could be made that Christian theology/doctrine/etc deserved credit for science.\n\nBut there was a 1500 year gap between Christianity and science, which makes it very difficult to credit Christianity for science. Why did the Church wait so long to pioneer science, if it could do that all along? Even if the early founders of science happened to be Christian, why would their religion get credit?\n\n>\tNew Atheism openly hated philosophy\n\nDaniel Dennett, Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens all *openly* hated philosophy? This is a first. When did they ever say such a thing? I'm genuinely curious.\n\n>\tnow \u201cNew\u201d New Atheism is following through and openly denying science, and when you point to scientific arguments and identify them as such they will finally break and admit they disagree with and hate science. I have even seen them take the Greek model of the universe\n\nThat's insane, who/where even are these people? I lurk around out in some pretty liberal/secular spaces, and this is the first time I'm hearing about these atheists who openly hate science and endorse the Greek model. What you're describing sounds like pure insanity that would be never supported by Hitchens/Harris/Dawkins/etc. It doesn't sound anything like atheism whatsoever. It sounds like mental illness (or trolls)."

We know when the Bible was compiled and by whom, and we know the origins of those stories.\n\nAs for the new testament, the whole point of being a Christian, and by extension a Catholic, is the belief that Jesus was the son of God, that he died for all the sins of humanity, and that he rose  from the dead as proof of God's power. Little details aside, I think every Christian believes in the overall story. Personally, I'm sure there were politics at play that Jesus' kin conveniently left out when retelling their lives to the next generation, but that doesn't really affect the overall series of events.\n\nAnyways, where I'm going with this is that things like the Big Bang Theory don't contradict church doctrine because Catholics don't necessarily believe that God created everything in 7 days and that all of existence has been static since then. This was a story meant to explain creation in a religion that doesn't require a creation story to be viable."

In terms of history deeds and events are being related, in terms of prophecy future events are being foretold. One should not look with a jaundiced eye, to be sure, on anyone who wants to take everything that is said here absolutely literally, and who can avoid blasphemy in so doing, and present everything as in accordance with Catholic faith; on the contrary one should hold up such a person as an outstanding and wholly admirable understander of the text.  \n>  \n>If, however, no other way is available of reaching an understanding of what is written that is religious and worthy of God, except by supposing that it has all been set before us in a figurative sense and in riddles, we have the authority of the apostles for doing this, seeing that they solved so many riddles in the books of the Old Testament in this manner. Let us then stick to this way which we have in mind, assisted by the one who urges us to ask, to seek and to knock; let us in fact unravel all these figurative statements in accordance with Catholic faith, whether they are statements of history or of prophecy, without prejudice to any better and more diligent commentary, whether by ourselves or by any others to whom the Lord may be good enough to reveal the meaning of the text. \n\nSaint Augustine, On Genesis, ed. John E. Rotelle, trans. Edmund Hill, vol. 13, The Works of Saint Augustine: A Translation for the 21st Century (Hyde Park, NY: New City Press, 2002), 72.\n\n>Also, this discovery has literally nothing specific relating it to original Christian ideology, lending further credence to the legitimacy of the theory.\n\nI'm curious on which of the early Christian writers you're basing your understanding of \"original Christian ideology.\" The Christians were often attacked (by Manicheans and Platonists, for instance) for asserting that the universe was not timeless. Ultimately Augustine and other patristic writers tended towards two viewpoints, 1) that Genesis is not a literal record in any sense in which we're discussing and 2) God as the source of all being exists outside of our human concept of time, and therefore is ultimately not answerable to \"this or that came first\" kinds of questions.\n\nTo the modern mind, #2 can come off as a dodge, especially for those who would prefer to ignore the fact that processes such as the scientific method are themselves unproveable via the scientific method. But it stands that Materialism cannot be mustered to prove Materialism, even though we all (Catholics included) recognize the immense contributions that those hermeneutics have made to our civilization, material culture, and our broader understanding of the universe.\n\nFinally, I would like to suggest that if you were to converse with Lemaitre--or for that matter Mendel, Grosseteste, Albertus Magnus, Kepler, Newton, etc.--and suggest that their theological and philosophical ideas are derived from an entirely different function of the mind than the knowledge they derive from observing the universe, the idea would not be received kindly."

The science is very settled on the subject and the consensus is that human activity is warming the planet beyond normal levels and is impacting earth\u2019s climate.\n\nclimate.nasa.gov/evidence/\n\nWhat right wingers do is find a few scientists that say otherwise, and out of deference to industrialists, act as if the science is not clear or can support both sides.  They do the same thing with evolution and certainly with things like the recent mask mandates.\n\nRight wingers simply lied about the masks efficacy science.  See for yourself:\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html\n\nhttps://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118\n\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776536\n\nIt\u2019s not the narrative it\u2019s the facts.\n\nThen there is the claim that science has been politicized and is all about money.  This claim is driven by right wing folks to invalidate science because it doesn\u2019t support their conclusions.\n\nAs someone on the left, I don\u2019t act is if the left doesn\u2019t ignore science and facts when it\u2019s convenient.  It amazes me when folks on the right ignore and just reject science that doesn\u2019t agree with their ideologies.  Facts are facts.\n\nEvolution is true and the church even acknowledge that evolution is true.  Right wingers still fight the fact of evolution and pick out the few scientists that disagree with evolution.\n\nAs a Christian, we must realize that we are called to serve Christ and adhere to what God commands us to do and to the teachings of the church and the church fathers.  This means that even though we have our political camps, they all (conservatives and liberals) run afoul what the Bible, Jesus and the church teach.  That is our primary allegiance.  Not left or right wing ideologies which are in many ways thoroughly unbiblical."

But the sort of claims that were once part of the homiletic repertoire of, say, Arthur C. Clarke or Carl Sagan--that the tradition of Greek science to which the rise of Christianity supposedly put an end was progressing inexorably toward modern physics, modern technology, and space travel--are sheer fantasy. To quote David C. Lindberg, \"It is agreed by most historians of ancient science that creative Greek science was on the wane, perhaps as early as 200 B.C., certainly by A.D. 200. Science had never been pursued by very many people; now it attracted even fewer...Creative natural science was particularly scarce in the Roman world, where scholarly interests leaned in the direction of ethics and metaphysics\"...And, as Lindberg also notes, there is no historical warrant for the belief \"that the advent of Christianity did anything to diminish the support given to scientific activity or the number of people involved in it.\"\n\nThat's David Bentley Hart quoting another scholar and historian of ancient science, and it more or less supports just about every understanding I had of the ancient world as a Classics major in my undergraduate days. If you believe the ancient Greeks (or lmao the Romans, of all people) were scientifically oriented in a way greater than that of the medieval Arab, Jewish, and Christian inheritors of the ancient tradition, I don't know what to tell you.\n\nIn fact, one of the earliest accusations hurled at the Christians *was* atheism, because of their refusal to recognize or offer sacrifices to the mind-boggling multiplicity of gods of every little facet of human life--and most importantly (for the state willing to persecute them), that included the gods and goddesses seen as necessary for the state's authority and functioning. The one thing a modern Catholic and a modern Atheist would agree upon looking back would be that the Roman state was a disastrously idolatrous one, and the fact that they would share that basic agreement should give you pause when you attempt to contrast your views with those of educated Christians who share your intellectual traditions and to assert that your scientism and atheism are somehow transhistorical, connecting you with a pure tradition in the distant past, the reality of which thankfully nobody currently exists to tell you otherwise."

I'm talking about the latter. As far as I know, not all church doctrine is absolute nor is all doctrine formed out of devotion to God. Politics has long been the basis for much of church doctrine.\n\nCreatio ex nihilo falls into that. God is limitless, that's a fundamental belief, but the Bible itself doesn't explicitly say that existence was created from non-existence. The concept emerged as a counter to Greek notion that God could only create from pre-existing matter. In other words, creation from nothing is a belief formed out of a human desire to justify God's power, but the reality is God doesn't need justification.\n\nIt's a far better position to say that we don't really know and it's not our place as mortal beings to comprehend or justify God's actions. In the context of the big bang, this means there was matter before that, or not. There's no way for us to know and that's by design. Someone who takes issue with the idea of God being limitless isn't likely to be a big believer in any Abrahamic religion anyway.\n\nIn summary, my position is that the universe may or may not have been created from nothing, but there's nothing that said it HAS to be one way or the other, at least nothing with a theological origin."

I feel like a lot of conservative Catholics hold a similar view, but don't openly announce it. Climate change, vaccines - that scientific information is time sensitive; we need to act on the best information we have. In contrast, something like string theory - that's not time sensitive at all. There's no morally urgent reason to hurry up and build the next particle smasher. We could, but it's not morally required. \n\nAlso, there is a knee jerk reaction to reject all scientific advancements just because there was a discrepancy with a particular data set or test.

Again you're right that correlation doesn't equal causation, but at the very least we can agree that religiosity is inversely correlated with education level."

And anyway I was referring to western nations during the last 1700 years such as in medieval times. In reality if you look at history, the last thing on king and queens/ empires minds was to educate the masses because that would give them power to rebel against the aristocracy. I appreciate the data you provide thank you. I read the article and in terms of states with high school diplomas it\u2019s a split in the top 10 states between red and blue. But again conservatism doesn\u2019t completely correlate with religious views either. Red doesn\u2019t mean automatically Christian or even catholic. There also are a lot of non partisan people such as myself so I\u2019m not red or blue so I don\u2019t really count here. Also we have to look at country\u2019s because the US isn\u2019t the whole world. The lack of education in South America for example has to do with terrible political situation and terrible presidents not so much religiosity. I\u2019m from Colombia myself."

Human creation myths involving deities always had them creating the world from pre-existing material or themselves.

Basically \"no, OUR God is the most powerful because he created everything from nothing.\" If this was an important topic, the Bible would have included it explicitly.\n\nIt is an opinion and currently the dominant viewpoint in the Catholic church, but this is coming from mortal men with a vested interest in ensuring the church grew quickly to out complete rival beliefs.

As a convert i can relate to the feeling he got from the friars that they were \"Just hanging out with me, they were not trying to sell me anything.\" The priest who guided me in my convertion was exactly like that: he talked to me and took time to be with me, just because he knew i was lost and wanted to help me. For a person that is outside the Church, the first experience of the unconditional love of Jesus can be through meeting a good and faithful priest."

And dash in the over the top aspect of fame. \n\nThere are \"plenty\" of kids who get into things and do great without Mommy Dearests pushing them into it. Then there are various angles and concerns. \n\nI know quite a few famously left or took breaks to do school and stuff. Like the original Becky in Roseanne, the potential Hollywood life not worth more than the other \"normal\" goals.\n\nBut honestly the REAL problem is we only care about and pay attention to children. If you look at adult actors they slowly get lost often too. Unless they put extra effort into not, and then you don't hear about them much since they don't get involved in nonsense, and thus they go unnoticed. Also, like the child actors that don't screw up, or stay low key and all that. \n\nSure we sensationalize famous people like this, but how many moms are going ham on their daughter at local dance class? How many dads beating a kid for missing the play in pee wee football. Same issues different places. \n\nI remember a kid in middle school wrestling, didn't do good, dad was yelling at him, gave him a purple nurple that bled... \n\nGeez I thought my dad got mad when I wasn't on it at baseball... but not compared to that. \n\nBut then all of it is complicated balances. Even adults hire people to act like a drill sergeant to achieve goals. If your kid wants to succeed they need SOME level of that. But not disordered levels. \n\nIt's very confusing, because if you're playing hippy parent your kid won't achieve any goals, won't be good at any sport, music, whatever they are into. Plus, we need to value some other skills more and similarly. If your kid has a fleeting fancy to be into a skill that can make millions (sports, music, acting) people go full out. But if the kid is like \"I think I want to bake\" it's more rare the parent helps create a master baker. A much more high percentage life skill in a lot of senses. \n\nAnd I think that's where the disorder comes to be more common in certain categories, the kid becoming a lottery ticket. Chasing the millions. I think more parents would be better at cultivating a baker, than a football star. Simply because the overreaction isn't as built into the idea of losing the extra hard, million maker."

I owe you respect, justice, etc. But I don't have to give you a present. If your friend randomly asks me to give you a present, and I do, that's a free act of charity, not some wrong that needed correcting. \n \nI see what you mean about celebrity vs. poor. My rebuttal to that is not many Catholics actually think to pray for famous people vs. the sick and poor who are constantly preached about and more generally sympathized with. And I also argue it's much harder to be a good Catholic in the Hollywood environment than a rando in obscurity.\n \nThe fact is, we aren't all-knowing. We don't have all the information, but the Church teaches as Truth that God already provides us with everything we need that could benefit our **eternal** good. I am a chronically ill person, for example. (in a lot of pain sometimes). If God hasn't healed me yet, I know it will work out for my good somehow. Doctors have to perform painful operations sometimes that last only temporarily (this life) in order to secure the long-term health of the patient (eternal life).\n \nWish you all the best"

By the way, all the homeless are regularly prayed for, not just by christians on earth but saints and angels aswell. It's not like there is a prayer crisis for certain groups of people. \n\nShia sincerely opened himself up to God that's the main reason why he answered him, not everyone is willing to do that. And just because he will have people praying for him doesn't mean his journey will be easy. The more one is given the more is expected of him."

I was already an Asian growing up in a very white Texas town. I was already a Catholic among mostly evangelicals. Whether it was the local parish or my parents, everything they made me do felt like forced participation, but now as I'm grown up, I actually very much appreciate it. Even if the TLM was available and I knew it existed, I would've felt even more forced, because it's just an even bigger contrast to my everyday experiences.\n\nIronically, it's the more \"praise and worship\"-accented NO liturgies that felt out of place. I used to want more of that kind of thing, but when I finally experienced that sort of thing, I started to realize that the grass is greener on the other side. It was, but that was just near the fence. None of it felt familiar. Mind you, this realization occurred over the course of several years. The NO at home, whose reverence I took for granted, is just what I was looking for. I'm now in a different diocese, but my current parish is at least as reverent as my memory serves, but with a little more traditional aesthetic and an actual choir. The TLM feels, to me, too out of place, but my current parish does bridge the gap. I do very much find the TLM admirable though. We shouldn't lose it, and more NO parishes ought to recover more from it, because while I grew up with a fairly reverent NO Mass, our whole Rite grew up with the TLM over several centuries, and I wish that we collectively try to recover what made us what we are over trying to fit in, like I was in my youth."

I stopped going to the gothic cathedral and started going to the local parish once I settled down, and I try to be patient when I think the singing tempo is too slow or our cantor is warbly. (I also have kids so I have zero standing to complain about anything, performance-wise) And of course, to counter consumerism, we have to be giving of ourselves: time, money, actions, talents, prayers.\n\nWhen I heard Shia\u2019s interview I checked the times on the closest EF parish and almost went that same day to the weekday mass.

As they learn to understand, as they *put in the work* to understand, then they realize they could never go back to their diet of \u201cmilk.\u201d \n\nThey\u2019ll still have tastes; very often part of the acquisition is developing very strong opinions about different manifestations of high culture, and learning to participate in that discourse. But their tastes will simply be opened to something that wasn\u2019t simply immediately gratifying or accessible, but which requires a patient process of learning and being inculturated by.\n\nAll that being said, I think the Latin is the *least* important part of the old rite, and trads insisting on complete Latin is shooting themselves in the foot and creating a deliberate ghetto. I believe traditional liturgy would grow explosively if a vernacular option were allowed (though personally I\u2019d keep the sung Ordinary parts, and the silent Canon, in Latin). I sympathize with people for whom the Latin does nothing for them. Yes, there are hand missals and such, but a nice poetic English translation would expose many more people to the riches of this liturgy beyond \u201cthere\u2019s a guy chanting at the wall up there in a language I don\u2019t understand.\u201d"

The newly consecrated host, now Christ himself, is not held up to us for veneration (though that's not bad), but offered to God himself on our behalf. The priest doesn't \"perform\" for his congregation, he faces the Tabernacle (Christ in the Eucharist) and leads us as we worship God together.

It wasn't just that he gave a powerful performance, I got the sense that something else was going on underneath all of it. Something, which I mentioned, I can't explain.

Some comments also imply a desire for collective prayer and blessings for LaBeouf's well-being, which is consistent with an authoritarian or collectivist perspective. However, the post itself does not advocate for government control or coercion, so it falls short of being very authoritarian (10).",

The discussion is centered around Shia LaBeouf's conversion to Catholicism and his involvement in a movie about Padre Pio, with some commenters expressing support and others offering words of caution. There doesn't appear to be any overtly political or ideological commentary, but rather a focus on the personal and spiritual journey of an individual celebrity.\n\nThe tone of the comments is generally positive and supportive, with many commenters praising LaBeouf's decision to explore his faith and some expressing gratitude for the potential impact it may have on others. While there are some wry observations about the potential backlash from Hollywood or the media, these comments are not overtly critical or ideological in nature.\n\nOverall, I would rate this post as 2 on the -10 to 10 scale, indicating a generally neutral and apolitical discussion focused on personal spirituality rather than partisan politics."

The comments that follow are overwhelmingly supportive and congratulatory, with some users sharing their own experiences or offering words of encouragement.\n\nThere is no indication of advocacy for government control or regulation in either the post or the comments. The tone is instead one of personal joy, spirituality, and community, which aligns more closely with libertarian values that emphasize individual freedom and choice.",

The comments also reflect a predominantly conservative or traditional Christian perspective, with many commenters expressing support and congratulations in a lighthearted and celebratory manner. There is no indication of radical social change, collective ownership, or strong government intervention, so it does not lean far left (-10). Similarly, the tone is not overtly critical of progressive policies or advocating for authoritarian measures, so it does not lean far right (10). Overall, the post and comments appear to be centered around traditional values and individual liberties, which aligns with a light right perspective."

It's downright depressing but I have been asking God to help me to find a good person to buy the car that He has in store for me. I will not reward evil doing!

To actually assume or assess someone's intentions is beyond our scope as Christians.\n\nEdit: I would just add that someone might see a picture of someone practicing their faith and may end up becoming more curious about the faith.

The liturgical calendar reverts back to \"ordinary time\". We no longer have to abstain from meat and fast on Fridays and holy days.\n\nBy \"meat\" Catholics abstain from red meat and poultry, as it was considered lavish or luxury.

It begins on Ash Wednesday (which was today) in which Catholics must try to go to Church and can receive ashes on their forehead (there is symbolism in it). Catholics are also called to abstain from meat and fast (depending on your age) on Ash Wednesday and Fridays during Lent. Those who fast only eat one normal meal and two small snacks during that day. This is meant as a spiritual sacrifice.  During Lent, Catholics usually focus on three things as preparation: fasting, praying, and almsgiving. The fasting can be for anything such as trying to stop a bad habit. During Lent, I try to stop my habits, hopefully permanently, and pray more. I also want to do some service projects. When it is over, we have hopefully grown spiritually, and we celebrate Holy Week and Easter. I'm not 100% sure on the fish part, but by abstaining from meat we only mean red meat and poultry since those used to be considered luxury foods. Hope I helped! I'm still learning a lot about Lent and Catholicism even though I was raised Catholic."

He would often then go on to point out that no one would have trouble coming up with the opposite: an immoral action that could only be performed by a believer. With all due respect to you, as I do commend dedication and commitment; this sounds like typical Catholic guilt. I blame the root concept in Catholicism of Original Sin\u2014the ludicrous idea that newborn babies are born with guilt (I.e. sins of their fore-bearers). Such beliefs are antithetical to the concepts of justice and modern morality which are based on personal accountability. In fact so is the Jesus as Savior concept.

So a lot of them send their kids there to get exposure to the West and learn foreign policy.\u00a0\n\nThe corollary effect is that Arabs who have connections to the Jesuits tend to be more westernized and to view Catholicism positively(if in a still patronizing way)."

The post appears to be a neutral and celebratory announcement of a new church being built on a significant holy site, with comments that are mostly positive and appreciative of the event. There is no apparent advocacy for government control or individual freedom, but rather a focus on religious community and shared values.",

The comments also reflect a diverse range of opinions and perspectives, with some expressing admiration for King Abdullah II's charitable move, while others share their personal experiences and thoughts on the significance of the event.\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, I notice that most commenters seem to be Catholic or have a positive view towards Catholicism, which could suggest a slight leaning towards traditional or conservative values."

Yes temporal punishment must be payed for, as God is just. No, you do not pay for eternal punishment, Christ took away the separation between God and man and the debt man owed in that sense.\n\nNo scapulars do not by themselves do any such thing. Again, a gross mischaracterization of the faith. It is the hope/faith in God\u2019s promises and the intercession of the faithful that such sacramentals participate in. Even then scapulars are private revelation, and the faithful are not bound to believe them, neither does the Church teach them to be infallible. It just says that they are good ways to build up hope in God.\n\nI also love that you ignored the scripture I quoted. The reason you did this is because you do not like what it says and so you refuse to argue with it, because you know you would be arguing against God\u2019s word with your own lackluster interpretation."

We know this because our blessed Lord also gives us the Lord\u2019s Prayer, which specifically says \u201cforgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.\u201d \n\nIt is talking about what you build your faith with. Notice the man who built with straw is still saved, but only through fire that burns up the parts of his building that were perishable. He is like a man who seeks God and the world at the same time, juggling them until his last day, where he repents of his worldliness and gives himself over to God. What you build with will be tested. Your soul will not enter the kingdom of heaven until sinful attachments are taken away by God. \n\nRevelation 21:27, along with the verses mentioned are enough to at least accept a surface level type of purgation or purification of the soul before entering heaven, even if you were to believe it to be instantaneous. I also am disappointed in your calumny. I have not downvoted him. I have tried to send a screen cap to show you but the private message will not go through. There are indeed two downvotes there, but they are not from me.\n\nMay the Lord bless you and your loved ones abundantly with all that you need, amen."

They would spend their time wondering through the forests and countryside.  My mom, as a little girl, would often meet them while she was out picking mushrooms berries, etc.\n\nThen later as university students in Krakow, my parents would often meet him at formal occasions, as he was very involved with youth even as a Cardinal.  They both said he had the ability to look into your soul, and it's as if he knew that you weren't in the state of grace.\n\nI only got to see him drive by during the WYD in Toronto."

Do the hundredth anniversary of his baptism instead maybe. But mostly, this whole model of anniversary is foreign to the Church\u2019s history.

While some users mention personal experiences or anecdotes about meeting him or being inspired by his teachings, there is no apparent ideological bias or advocacy for radical social change. The tone is generally positive and apolitical, making the post lean towards the center-right on the given range."

However, there needs to be some nuance here, let's compare it to acronyms.\n\nNow acronyms are definitely abbreviations but not all abbreviations are acronyms. Similarly hot dogs, as in a frankfurter with a bun and condiments, is a special type of sandwich, but not all sandwiches are hot dogs. Acronyms and hot dogs makeup a specific sub-type within a more general grouping but the main goal being attained by hot dogs and acronyms is the same as abbreviations and sandwiches, case closed.\n\nEdit: we dont refer to hot dogs as sandwiches in common language because it doesnt convey the specifics needed for procuring a hot dog."

A family in our parish had very premature quadruplets, and called the parish priest to come and baptize them, as they were in very serious condition. He actually told them that's what Hospital chaplains are for. Well, HELLO! Most hospital chaplains aren't Catholic priests! I know that in \"emergencies,\" lay people can baptize, but I was really surprised and disappointed by his response. Fast-forward 15 years, when I was gravely ill and in a coma and not expected to live. I did, in fact, survive, and my husband's best friend, who was there with him, and to whom I had been close, was at the hospital alone when the priest showed up. He and my husband had been the only ones allowed in the ICU room to see me/be with me, but the friend(correctly) took it upon himself to inform the staff that they should allow the priest in. I SWEAR that if I had suddenly \"awakened\" from that coma, and had seen him, I would've been convinced that I had died and gone to hell! Our St. Vincent de Paul Society at our parish did all of the \"social ministry\"/food/rent/utility assistance, etc. When someone would present at the church office asking for help, an SVDP member would be called. I was once asked to get that filthy person out of the church office to interview her! The members of our group used to \"joke\" that church office staff should answer the phone by saying, \"Saint \"XYZ\" what do you think this is? A church?\""

All the rules and regulations of the Church were unknown to me, but I did know I could legitimately baptize them. So I looked up how to do it and did it over the bathroom sink while each was sleeping in my arms. \n\nThen I wrote a brief baptismal certificate\u2019 stating that I had baptized them using all the proper elements necessary (water, In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, etc). I signed and dated and filed them for the kids\u2019 records. \n\nSince then my husband has had a change of heart (unsurprising really - the Holy Spirit gets what the Holy Spirit wants) and I have become a confirmed Catholic. My kids are both in Catholic school now. \n\nI have talked to my priest and he agreed that my baptism of them was valid, despite its unorthodoxy. \n\nPeople can downvote all they want. It doesn\u2019t matter. I am concerned about what the Lord\u2019s will is \u2026 not theirs."

The comments are overwhelmingly positive and spiritual, with users expressing gratitude and admiration for the artist's talent, but there is no advocacy for individual freedom or criticism of government control. However, some comments express appreciation for the artist's ability to create something beautiful without reference to any external authority, which may suggest a lightly libertarian leaning in terms of artistic expression and personal creativity.",

The language used by commenters is overwhelmingly positive and reverent, with many expressing gratitude to God for the artist's talent and asking for blessings upon them. While some users mention Jesus Christ specifically, there is no clear indication of any radical social change or advocacy for collective ownership. The tone of the comments suggests a more conservative or traditional perspective, but it does not lean far enough in either direction to suggest extreme nationalism or authoritarianism."

                "content": "\nMy opinion of this photo is two fold.\n1. It's a nice photo and symbolizes Christ from Heaven, creator. The moon a natural material, created, and the church which in many ways represents both, in that the church are men, made of dust, much like the moon, but also heirs of that from heaven, attained only through Christ (Sun/Son) whom shines. This is my sentimental assessment of the image.\n\nAnd then there is my spiritual assesment.\n\n2. The moon, which men did not create is a reflection of the Suns light. In the same way, we men, whom neither did we create ourself is 'The Church\" (ekklesia, assembly) and it's us men, individual men (assembled especially, but not neccesarily corporate) that reflects the Son. We only reflect this Son when we recieve the light that issues from Son. Just as the moon in the image. However isn't it enlightening, to see that it's the world, that blocks the light of the Sun on the moon? It's the world that casts darkness, not the Sun/Son. \n\nThe church in the image, is not a reflection of the Sun, but an artificial light, made by men. It doesn't reflect that which is from heaven, but only attempts to mimic that light. And the statue of Christ, made of earthen material, made by men, much like babel, made by brick (manmade) not by stone (Gods provision). Is erected maybe in the same spirit as the golden calf, maybe. And again an artificial light shined on it for all the world to see. \n\nThe churchs light in the photo again is manmade, aritificial. For the men that treats church as a corporation (for profit or not) to be a member of based on doctrine, programs, beliefs, etc. has to shine their own light on it, because it has no real light from the Sun/Son to give. \n\nThe True Church are those that surrender to the Absolute Grace that is issued, one that is poured out in abundance on mankind where men, eventually have 'no choice' but to surrender too. When this True Church emerges from this dark world , and assemble. Then men, and churches will no longer need an artificial light that we call doctrine, trendy programs, charismatic leaders that we shine like selfies upon ourselves. But the Son Himself will shine on us, once world is rendered void to the point it has no darkness and no shadow to cast."

The discussion revolves around spirituality, symbolism, and personal interpretations of the image, with some comments touching on Catholicism and Christian theology. There is no apparent push for government control or individual freedom as primary concerns in this context.",
        "left_to_right_rating": "6 \n\nThe post's tone and content are primarily focused on spiritual interpretation and personal reflection, rather than explicitly advocating for any particular ideology or policy. The author's comments about the church, Christ, and the moon can be seen as philosophical and introspective, rather than taking a clear stance on left-right politics. While some of the language and references (e.g., \"Absolute Grace,\" \"ekklesia\") may lean slightly towards a more conservative or traditional Christian perspective, it does not exhibit any overtly radical, socialist, or nationalist rhetoric that would categorize it as far left or right. Therefore, I would rate this post as 6, indicating a light-right leaning due to the emphasis on individual faith and personal interpretation, but without explicitly advocating for free-market capitalism or limited government intervention."

He is not blessing gay marriage..  he is not, strictly speaking, \"blessing\" civil unions or affording those unions the same status as sacramental marriage. But i have lost count of the number of people informing me today the Church i belong to is the Church of anti Christ because Francis has sanctioned sodomy. What he needs to do...immediately...is clarify his statements. All it has done is sown confusion."

Therefore, he that hath delivered me to thee, hath the greater sin. [12] And from henceforth Pilate sought to release him. But the Jews cried out, saying: If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar's friend. For whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Caesar.\n\n...\n\n[21] Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate: Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am the King of the Jews.

There are better systems in place to protect those who would be preyed upon. Yes, some of these people weasled their way into positions of power. You know who's more pissed off about them than you? Actual catholics. We don't have an oppression-complex either, but it is true that the RCC is the only religion/ group of people that it's ok to hate. If you don't see that, then you're as willfully ignorant as you accuse me of being. \n\nBy the way, independent studies have shown than 50% of the time a sexual abuser is family. Of the remaining, 1.8% of clergy are guilty of abusing minors. Contrast this with the 9% of public school faculty who were also shuffled around and protected by unions. This problem isn't uniquely catholic, it's a human problem.\n\nIf you're up to it, try to get some of your information from places other than anti-catholic memes. You'll learn more, sound more rational, and be able too think for yourself.\n\nIt's clear though that you aren't looking to learn, or have open discussion.

Autistic children need more structure to function in social situations. By allowing him to do this, he is learning that he can act on impulses  regardless of The social or safety situations\n\n For example, in the everyday real world, you walk in to a bank that you have never been into before, you will find the counter and get in line because you are able to generalize the appropriate social behaviors. Now, if a person with autism was put in situation and they just go up to the counter and skip the line, what would happen?  People would become upset and the person with autism would be put in an unpleasant and possible dangerous situation. The goal of any person regardless of diagnoses is to function responsibility in society. By allowing children with autism to be exempt from expectation we are failing them. \n\nNow, I am in no way saying that their disability be ignored, I am saying we still have a responsibility to educate in all areas including socially using acceptable strategies that are tailored to their individual needs. The goal is always Independence.\n"

                "content": "Christ does actually say that he is referring to humility though so I think it's fair to say that he is definitely referring to 'humbling oneself as a little child' however you want to interpret that.\n\n> At that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying: Who thinkest thou is the greater in the kingdom of heaven? [2] And Jesus calling unto him a little child, set him in the midst of them, [3] And said: Amen I say to you, unless you be converted, and become as little children, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. [4] **Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, he is the greater in the kingdom of heaven.** [5] And he that shall receive one such little child in my name, receiveth me. - Matthew 18:2-4\n\nWell I haven't read the little flower so I can't speak for that, but as far as children go, I suppose it depends on the child. Suffice to say children were probably pretty different in Christ's time to how they are today. On that note though, regardless of whether children submit to their parents or not, I would certainly say that they *should*. If St Paul exhorts wives to submit to their husbands then it goes without saying that children should submit to their parents and even more so should mere beings submit to God."

However, some comments that follow are worth noting:\n\n*   Some users express admiration for the scene, describing it as \"beautiful\" and \"cute.\"\n*   Others seem to enjoy poking fun at the situation, making light of the child's actions.\n*   A few commenters appear more serious, discussing the Swiss Guard's role in protecting the Pope and questioning their ability to respond to an attack.\n\nThe overall tone is mostly playful, but also occasionally critical or humorous. The post seems to be generally leaning towards a libertarian stance by not explicitly advocating for any particular government control or regulation, and instead focusing on a lighthearted moment between the child and the Swiss Guard",
        "left_to_right_rating": "4 \n\nThis rating suggests that the post is generally apolitical or leans slightly towards the right, as there are no radical left-wing comments advocating for collective ownership, wealth redistribution, or strong government intervention. The tone of most comments seems to be neutral and appreciative of the moment captured in the image, with some people expressing amusement or nostalgia. There are a few comments that could be interpreted as poking fun at authority figures, but these do not appear to be driven by any ideological agenda. Overall, the discussion seems to be light-hearted and focused on the human interest aspect of the story rather than any specific policy or social issue."
