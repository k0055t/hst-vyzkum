Yes hamas is bad and they did and do some really terrible shit. However if your takeaway from this is that hamas is just getting consequences for their actions then you truly have no understanding of history or how these cycles persist. Israel has historically and currently always been the aggressor. This creates massive amounts of contempt and so people are going to seize back the power that was taken from them in whatever ways that they can. \n\nJust about every terrorist faction exists because they are a response to the degradation of an entire people by imperialism. People will not care about their terrible ideology if they promise to stand up for them. America has single handedly created more terrorists than any shitty dogma in the Middle East. Israel is doing the same thing, but far more overtly. Fascism creates fascism and israel knows this. They will continue to further oppress and destroy the Palestinian people until the Palestinians respond in whatever desperate grab for power they can. They will then use this as an example for why they must continue to genocide them because look at how savage they are."

Why did they indiscriminately bomb Gaza with glee when most actual Hamas fighters would be mostly immune in their tunnels? \n\nIt just doesn't make sense that Bibi and his government would groom Hamas for years to work them into a frenzy so they would send the Palestinian people to their deaths, then do everything in their power to make sure Hamas's one big attack would inflict maximum carnage upon innocent Jews, then use that as an excuse to level Gaza where much of the Palestinians live.\n\nWhat would Bibi and his cabinet gain from artificially forcing a rally around the flag effect by being an accomplice to an attack on their own country?

I\u2019m only adding the necessary context to Israel\u2019s decision. \n\nWhy is it that you \u201criver to the sea\u201d people are so eager to blame Israel for Palestinian collateral deaths as a result of HAMAS using civilians as human shields, but are so reluctant to condemn the intentional rape, butchering, torture and slaughter of peaceful Israeli civilians? \n\nYou were all calling this war a \u201cgenocide\u201d of PALESTINIANS on Oct. 8th before any retaliation had begun and the Israeli bodies were still warm. \n\nReeks of antisemitism."

You don't have to be particularly cynical or uncaring to not trust the people who literally launched a sneak attack against civilians not even a week ago.\n\nSeriously think through how this goes if Israel says yes. The best case scenario which will never happen cause we live in the real world is that somehow all the hostages are released and the violence doesn't escalate. Except this would never happen simply because of basic logistical issues. The list of hostages itself has long been unclear and it was less clear back than. There were lots of people who were missing and it wasn't clear which of them were dead and which of them were kidnapped. There isn't some central prison these people were being kept at they were being held hostage by tons of smaller groups some which might not even obey if Hamas leadership had ordered them to release the hostages. Realistically Israel says yes Hamas returns some of the hostage and Israel is left with a list of missing people that they aren't entirely sure if they are dead or Hamas is holding out on them. So where does the situation go from there does Israel just not try to recover the citizens whose status they can't verify but Hamas hasn't returned?"

Nobody treats places like North Korea like they are the \"good guys,\" so there is not really much to protest against in your own nation. The perception is that Israel gets to do whatever it wants with no consequences from groups that have the power and means to enact those consequences, and in fact gets favorable treatment from the governments of the people protesting."

This particular situation hits home though. The west has so many connections to Israel that when we see a friend doing something so awful folks feel entitled to make a scene about it.\n\nSo to summarized, nothing is special about this other than it's the slaughter of thousands of citizens, murder of aid workers, destruction of schools, and hospitals.

She then grabs an 11th person and puts them in her closet. Your purposeful ignorance is supporting the idea that in that situation, I then murder her and everyone who shares the same race as her in the entire country. I also kill the person she put in her closet because I dont care about them. Is it acceptable to murder her and everyone who shares her ethnicity (which would include you) *and* the person she kidnapped? Before you answer, \u201cno, genocide is always wrong\u201d remember, this would be happening because a woman killed 10 innocent people after she was tortured for five years and put someone in her closet.

However, most of the comments lean towards the more authoritarian side as they advocate for a strong central control over the conflict and accuse Israel of genocide, imperialism, and hypocrisy.",
        "left_to_right_rating": "-7 \n\nThe post discusses a sensitive and complex topic, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and presents quotes from an article that suggest the possibility of a hostage deal being rejected by Hamas. The comments are largely critical of Israel's actions and policies, with many users expressing outrage and accusing the Israeli government of committing genocide or using the conflict as an excuse to expand its territory.\n\nSeveral comments specifically mention \"genocide,\" \"occupation,\" and \"blood for money,\" which are terms often associated with left-wing or radical criticisms of Israel. Some users also imply that Israel is responsible for creating terrorism by oppressing the Palestinian people, which is a common argument made on the far-left end of the political spectrum.\n\nHowever, not all comments fall into this category. A few users express skepticism about the hostage deal and question whether it was real or if the Israeli government would have used it as an excuse to justify its actions. These users seem more balanced in their views, but they are still critical of Israel's policies.\n\nOverall, based on the content and tone of the comments, I would rate this post a -7, indicating that it leans far-left in its political orientation."

They're also the only Democratic western nation to try children as young as 12 in Military tribunals. \n\nAnd you can't say Jewish spy? How many Jews out there like the hero Norman Finklestein are screaming NOT in OUR NAME! And yet ignored. The issue isn't Judaism. It's Zionism.

I definitely see where you're coming from, and it is irritating that she has to this kind of stream, which is clearly meant as a defense against accusations of antisemitism. The whole setup sorta naturally lends itself to nodding along -- taking a challenging tone would kinda defeat the point. But all that said, I think there's more (emotional, perhaps) truth to fears of antisemitism than you seem to entertain. Trying to get into a discussion about where exactly antisemitism falls in terms of \"importance\" to stopping the flow of weapons is possible in vague terms, but used in too absolute of a sense here IMO. It's like trying to get to the bottom of who really has it worse in the USA, women or black men; does it really matter? Can't we work with Jewish orgs on stuff like swastikas and politicians blaming wildfires on them, while also pushing them all to gather more and more support for a demilitarized isreal?\n\n  \nUltimately my only hope for this conflict is that the Isrealis are good people. All people are good people -- it's the capitalist rules who fuck things up. I truly think that beneath the layers of nationalism and hatred, there is a true sense in which they just want to live their lives in peace, and would happily sacrifice the relatively minor wealth that the occupation brings their state. Obviously not the religious extremists/settlers, but the voting citizen who has memories of the IDF and also was out protesting Netanyahu's authoritarianism last year. \n\nI mean I agree with John Oliver that the UN should immediately invade and set up a DMZ by force if necessary, but short of that, convincing isreali voters seems like one of our main paths to peace"

I\u2019m a proud American and many of those in my community are proud Americans, insinuating otherwise is insulting.\n\nHaving Israeli friends, I can say that Sefard\u00ed and Mizrahi culture are massive parts of Israeli culture. The food, art, and music associated with Israel is mainly that of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern Jews. There\u2019s plenty of racism within Israel towards other Jews, especially surrounding Beta Israel (Ethiopian Jews) but acting as though only Ashkenazis are valued is ridiculous.\n\nSaying that Ashkenazi Jews \u201caren\u2019t semitic\u201d isn\u2019t true, DNA tests have shown that most Ashkenazi Jews have  both European and Middle Eastern heritage. (https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781644699850/html#contents). Does this mean that Israel belongs to them by blood-right? Of course not, but denying people their heritage is wrong.\n\nI agree with Norman Finkelstein, and as a descendent of Holocaust survivors I find it ghoulish that the Israeli government has used the past suffering of Jews to goad public opinion on their actions. Still, I dislike wheeling out one or two token Jews to act as yes men and give an anti-bigotry stamp on things."

There are technically other parties, but they don't function the same way parties in the US work. In China parties form to address specific groups or issues, so for example a women's party that specifically addresses women's issues. But yes, for general governmental purposes, there is only the CPC. Still, this is more similar to the US than people think. There is one primary party in China, the communist party. The communist party has 100 active million members. It is the largest party in the world. In other words, the CPC is not a monolith. There is disagreement and debate, there are factions formed by those with opposing opinions, there are all the things you'd expect when 100 million people try to work together. So yes, there is only the one party (sort of), and all the candidates may be communists, but there are still plenty of debates and differences between members and candidates. Hell, there are even disagreements about communism, how to achieve it, how quickly to transition, etc. \n\nCompare that to the US. We've got two parties, the capitalist party and the capitalist party. There are differences between them, things they disagree about, they even disagree about capitalism and how to implement it properly. But they are all capitalists. So in effect, we have a very similar system. We call our groups parties, China calls them factions, both are united with their opponents by the economic system they support."

I did. I went in hoping it was an honest/good conversation about antisemitism. But in actuality it was Israeli government propaganda. The talk can be boiled down to: criticism against Israel is antisemetic because 90% of Jews have a link/tie to that country. So in essence, we are not allowed to boycott the genocidal terrorist Israeli regime because Jews have links/ties to it. This is a ridiculous position. The entire stream was ridiculous, with AOC stating briefly at the start that criticism of Israel is not antisemetic, only to have this declaration be undermined without challenge for the next 30 minutes by 2 zionists. Then she stated that her view and the view of the 2 guests about the war are not the same.\n\nWhy give them platform? Why not have a neutral party talk about antisemitism instead of zionists?

I feel much if Mizrahi and Shepardi culture was taken as a way for Ashkenazi to feel they belong in the way my people the Irish stole kilts from the Scots to feel more \"Celtic\" but that's a whole other issue. \n\nI don't think anyone should paint Jews as this single entity so I suppose I can understand the issue with Jewish spies but it seems to me more a descriptor for someone not fully educated on the culture and issues and to them Israel and Judaism are intertwined. So I can see that for an anti Zionist Jew such a term and descriptor can be painful so I can see your point and concede I was too harsh on that front. \n\nAs you can tell it's a very emotionally charged issue for many. I am Irish and the scars of British colonialism is still seen in Ireland and in the North, so there has always been a solidarity with the Palestinians. \n\nFor me personally I met my fiance on a pro Palestine Reddit page. She is Arab and Muslim and lives in Jordan. Since my relationship with her I have visited the middle east and regularly attend Mosques. The things I have seen have irrevocably changed my worldview. I used to think Muslims the bad guys. I've been to many mosques. I've never heard anyone say a thing bad about Jews. The Israeli government? Of course. But I have always heard Muslims speak respectfully toward Jews and revere them and the culture as fellow people of the book. \n\nI had one incident after a community event at a local mosque where a teenage Palestinian boy said something fucked up and he was shut down so fast by everyone around him. I was shocked. As someone who spent much of my life in the US and the West, it was normal to hear anti Muslim talk and racist talk. My Dad regularly advocated nuking the entire middle east except Israel. Even in online forums the lack of actual anti semitism was a bit surprising. It always got shut down by others and down voted. But the opposite wasn't true of American Christians and many Zionist Jews. \n\nNow obviously no one people are bad. We're all humans and genetically are so similar, the idea of races isn't a true thing beyond culture and socio economic status. There's no biological facts behind the idea of races (i.e. black and white or Asian, etc). I don't believe Israelis are inherently bad. How could they be? \n\nHowever, I do believe generational trauma is a thing. I do believe that abuse often begets abuse. With many Israeli settlers in the 40's coming from Europe, they suffered unimaginable horrors. They wanted what's best for their people. To ensure their survival. That alone can make men cruel. But throw in what Jews faced in Europe for centuries and I can see how such trauma can be manifested in the ways it has been. I think it also was exploited by those in power as it always has been since the beginning of mankind. \n\nIn turn this has created an endless cycle like in Northern Ireland. One group strikes out at another and a cycle of endless retaliation is set into motion. No side wants to forget their dead. No side can forget how they were wronged. I think the US exploits Israel for its own gains as well. \n\nWhat I would like to see is a democratic secular Palestine that is open to Jews, Muslims, Druze, Christians, etc. and a right of return for ANYONE with roots there. A multi ethnic state not based on any single ethnicity. Not a Muslim state or Jewish State or Arab State. But a place anyone can go to. That would be ideal."

Even in real life my sister was harassed by a group of Pakistani students at her university, calling her a baby-rapist since she worked at our synagogue\u2019s preschool.

He's powerless to halt supreme court decisions. But - with the support of the Senate - he *can* appoint supreme court and federal justices. He *can* veto bigoted legislation, and he *can* write executive orders - both of which he has and has pledged to do. He can update regulatory statutes, as he did with Title IX for trans people and as red states are currently fighting in the federal court. He can fire federal employees who go against his goals - something Biden hasn't done as much as I'd like, but something Trump intends to do *aggressively*. \n\nCurrently, we're seeing major erosions in human rights in heavily gerrymandered red states. In blue states, we're seeing the opposite. In a case where a red president with enough pull in both chambers of congress (currently, we're about 50/50 with two ostensibly democrat-aligned centrists in the senate) and has a red supreme court, that no longer applies - we start seeing things get a lot worse, everywhere. The courts are the scariest, because of the lifetime appointments. That could make things very painful for decades.\n\nThere's an extreme difference between what we're seeing now, versus a nightmare scenario where Trump or someone like him is rubber stamping whatever horrors the Heritage Foundation comes up with. If you love anyone in those gunsights, I urge you to consider being strategic with your vote in November. It isn't about loving or even supporting the democrats - it's about the republicans being just that bad."

But my brother goes to Columbia and he doesn't show his views on political issues in any way publicly. But he had to start taking his classes online because he was getting yelled at and berated by protesters for wearing a kippah and being openly jewish. These people make those who promote your cause be portrayed in a bad light because a lot of people lose sight of the ultimate goal which is to save lives and protect the rights of people. So please, protest, take to the streets, lobby, boycott, whatever. Because this is the basis of change and I'm willing to accept that my views might be wrong and maybe change is needed. But please, do not harass others as a way of proving your point, it almost never works. Look at history, some of the most successfull protests were entirely peaceful, look at ghandis protest of British rule, he told tens of millions of people to peacefully protest British rule and over time they succeeded in establishing an independent democratic government. So actually discuss issues and find common ground because a lot of Palestinians don't want the death of the jews and a lot of Israelis and pro israel jews don't want the death of Palestinians. This is an issue between governments, not people. Sorry for the whole essay and don't tear me up in your replies because I know it's a pressing issue but the urgency of an issue should not override the rights of individuals who are unrelated or even related."

Socialism and Communism sound good, but the track record of both doesn\u2019t hold up. We\u2019re all standing on all the power and riches we need to achieve a better country. Who doesn\u2019t remember the cry, \u201cNo taxation without representation\u201d? A top-down rule of government   has never been the answer. How willing are we to stand against the IRS? It might mean imprisonment and ridicule, but the threat of refusal of a significant percentage of US citizens to pay their federal income taxes for 2024 is CERTAIN to get government at all levels to stand down; take notice; and listen. No system of government is perfect, but this society of ours is only as good as we all make it to be. Foregoing some liberties and pleasures in service of betterment will be required, but isn\u2019t it worth it? See the world:  Why do so many want to leave their homes and come here? We must have a return to common sense. We don\u2019t need revolution, we need reform:  Gentle; self-sacrificial; but resolute. Our nation didn\u2019t develop its problems overnight, and they won\u2019t be solved overnight\u2014in fact, they probably won\u2019t be solved in the lifetime of any that read this post.

Look at Afghanistan, it\u2019s 1:9. Most wars are 1:9.  \n\nIsrael has multiple policy of reducing civilian deaths in conventional warfare. They are not committing genocide. They are at war with Hamas.\n\nHamas has actually stated they want to genocide Jews, and they do launch terror attacks directed at killing civilians and taking hostages. These are real war crimes. Hamas also will not build bomb shelters or allow civilians in the tunnels. They put their positions under civilians to use them as a deterrent or if there is a strike, they use it for their propaganda war. \n\nWar is terrible and awful things happen, but this is what war looks like. \n\nAlso Israel isn\u2019t a colony and it doesn\u2019t have colonies. Jews have always existed there. There was no larger Jewish empire that colonized the area. It is so obvious this lie is just to get America.

For example in the case if Ukraine and Russia, the solution is for Russia to stop attacking Ukraine. It's not so black and white in Israel, Palestine. On one hand Israel is much more powerful than Palestine, and is guilty of using that power to infict horrors on the Palestinian people without much interference. Meanwhile the Gaza Strip is ruled by insane terrorists who would gladly see Israel wiped out as a nation. While Israel is far from innocent, Hamas are much worse. They don't care about the lives of either Israelis or their own people. The more Palestinians who are killed, the more recruits they get for their cause. Israel can't realistically allow Hamas to stay in charge, but going too harsh radicalizes people. Unfortunately I don't see a solution to this problem anytime soon. Although I would like to see both Hamas and Netanyahu gone. I would also like Israel to crack down on illegal settlements in the West Bank."

The important part is when he acknowledges the gross injustices and overreach that Israel has taken since then and his public position changed. This isn't a popular position among politicians right now, it's not a take you have for performance points, imo."

This was dated 31st January 1970 and was read on 3rd February, the day after Bertrand Russell\u2019s death, to an International Conference of Parliamentarians meeting in Cairo.\n\nRussell's full statement \u2014\n\n\u2501\u2501\n\u201cThe latest phase of the undeclared war in the Middle East is based upon a profound miscalculation. The bombing raids deep into Egyptian territory will not persuade the civilian population to surrender, but will stiffen their resolve to resist. This is the lesson of all aerial bombardment. The Vietnamese who have endured years of American heavy bombing have responded not by capitulation but by shooting down more enemy aircraft. In 1940 my own fellow countrymen resisted Hitler\u2019s bombing raids with unprecedented unity and determination. For this reason, the present Israeli attacks will fail in their essential purpose, but at the same time they must be condemned vigorously throughout the world.\n\nThe development of the crisis in the Middle East is both dangerous and instructive. For over 20 years Israel has expanded by force of arms. After every stage in this expansion Israel has appealed to \u201creason\u201d and has suggested \u201cnegotiations\u201d. This is the traditional role of the imperial power, because it wishes to consolidate with the least difficulty what it has already taken by violence. Every new conquest becomes the new basis of the proposed negotiation from strength, which ignores the injustice of the previous aggression. The aggression committed by Israel must be condemned, not only because no state has the right to annex foreign territory, but because every expansion is an experiment to discover how much more aggression the world will tolerate. The refugees who surround Palestine in their hundreds of thousands were described recently by the Washington journalist I.F. Stone as \u201cthe moral millstone around the neck of world Jewry.\u201d Many of the refugees are now well into the third decade of their precarious existence in temporary settlements. \n\nThe tragedy of the people of Palestine is that their country was \u201cgiven\u201d by a foreign Power to another people for the creation of a new State. The result was that many hundreds of thousands of innocent people were made permanently homeless. With every new conflict their number have increased. How much longer is the world willing to endure this spectacle of wanton cruelty? It is abundantly clear that the refugees have every right to the homeland from which they were driven, and the denial of this right is at the heart of the continuing conflict. No people anywhere in the world would accept being expelled en masse from their own country; how can anyone require the people of Palestine to accept a punishment which nobody else would tolerate? A permanent just settlement of the refugees in their homeland is an essential ingredient of any genuine settlement in the Middle East.\n\nWe are frequently told that we must sympathize with Israel because of the suffering of the Jews in Europe at the hands of the Nazis. I see in this suggestion no reason to perpetuate any suffering. What Israel is doing today cannot be condoned, and to invoke the horrors of the past to justify those of the present is gross hypocrisy. Not only does Israel condemn a vast number. of refugees to misery; not only are many Arabs under occupation condemned to military rule; but also Israel condemns the Arab nations only recently emerging from colonial status, to continued impoverishment as military demands take precedence over national development.\n\nAll who want to see an end to bloodshed in the Middle East must ensure that any settlement does not contain the seeds of future conflict. Justice requires that the first step towards a settlement must be an Israeli withdrawal from all the territories occupied in June, 1967. A new world campaign is needed to help bring justice to the long\u2013suffering people of the Middle East.\u201c\n\n\u2014 Bertrand Russell, Yours Faithfully, Bertrand Russell: A Lifelong Fight for Peace, Justice, and Truth in Letters to the Editor, p. 411 \nOriginally published: 20 August 2001"

I'm not asking him to approve of Israeli acts in this war, but yes as a Jew it hurts my guts to see this man standing with a group that chants 'death to the Jews' and 'gas the Jews'.\n\n\nIt is at least hypocritical of him to say Netanyahu is using antisemitism for political profit while he does the exact same thing"

The comments are also diverse and range from agreement with the author's views to criticism, but none of them seem to be advocating for authoritarianism or libertarianism specifically.",

The post also expresses solidarity with Palestinian struggles and quotes Nelson Mandela and Bertrand Russell to support its argument. Overall, the tone is critical of Western powers' support for Israel and advocates for a more socialist or communist approach to addressing global issues.\n\nIt's worth noting that some comments in the thread express varying degrees of agreement or disagreement with the post's views, but the overall sentiment seems to be aligned with far-left politics."

They also stated their goal is the extermination of jewish people, and will absolutely not stop unless stopped. \nNeither side was ever gonna negotiate in good faith. That\u2019s part of what makes this such a difficult issue to really even talk about-  neither side is the good side."

Nation states are OK with a certain number of casualties to their own people when there is a war- which is certainly the state of affairs after hamas attacked.\n\nI think the Israelis could use other strategies to pursue hamas.\n\nI think they are well past when they could have roped it in and also having made their wrath known.\n\nBut the Hamas attack left 1200 dead and 8000 injured with 140 kidnapped. The response was never going to be exclusively about what is best for the 140 who might or might not be alive in captivity.\n\n\nThink about how the deal goes down. Was it supposed to instantly happen? Like Hamas passes word to the Egyptians for the Israelis and it says, \"hey if you guys do absolutely nothing at all about what we just did and bring your entire military system to a crashing halt, we will release the hostages we already took and not kill any more people like we just did in the last few days.\" \n\nFor that matter, if the safe return of the hostages was to be rigidly connected to the immediate halt of an Israeli response, why weren't they all killed immediately on the continuation of the Israeli attack?\n\nNegotiating for hostages is just a terrible strategy anyhow. Again, hamas killed 1200 and injured 8000 who were NOT hostages. Why would Israel ever cease operations against hamas to theoretically preserve the lives of 140 people when leaving hamas to their own devices let them rack up all those other casuaties?"

But they DO know that in the response, the onus of world opinion would be entirely on Israel not to harm civilians in the response- a practical absurdity.  Certainly no similar burden is laid on Hamas- they're terrorists, their bad conduct is presumed and to an extent it is accepted. \n\n\nBut hamas needs this kind of response from Israel because the purpose of hamas is not to secure a two state solution, nor to secure sovereignty of Palestine or even the destruction of israel. It is to keep Israel occupied and to complicate her foreign relations so that other regional actors can quietly change their own foreign policies and situations without drawing a response from other actors. It's not like news coverage is going to leave the student protests and the clumsy response of local police off the evening TV in favor of something else in the middle east for anything past a few bylines. And while all governments have state departments exclusively for monitoring and informing their legislators and executives about other affairs, they just don't get the same priority when people are in the streets, incensed at lopsided casualty figures.\n\nI don't blame Israel for conducting a vigorous war to destroy hamas and I don't accept the premise that this is genocide, even as I wish they would somehow do this with absolutely zero civilian deaths. I also know that I'm in the minority here. But I am sadder still that palestinian blood is the price of participation for Hamas in this cynical fashion in which they operate because while the IDF fights for Israel, nobody is actually fighting for the palestinians."

The author appears to be advocating for a more critical examination of Israeli actions and policies towards Palestine, suggesting that Israel could have negotiated with Hamas to release hostages without entering the strip. This perspective is more aligned with libertarian ideals, which emphasize individual freedom and autonomy.\n\nHowever, some comments, such as those from WindowSprays and DoeCommaJohn, express more authoritarian views, arguing that one should not negotiate with terrorists or that the Israeli response was justified. Other comments, like Extra_Jeweler_5544's, are inflammatory and unhelpful to the discussion.\n\nThe overall tone of the post is critical of Israeli actions and suggests a more nuanced approach to conflict resolution, which leans towards a libertarian perspective.",
        "left_to_right_rating": "Based on the content and tone of the post, I would rate it as -7.\n\nThe comments range from strongly anti-Israeli government and pro-Hamas sentiments to some more nuanced opinions, but overall, the tone is critical of Israel's actions and sympathetic towards Hamas' demands for a ceasefire and release of hostages. The language used by some commenters also echoes anti-Zionist and anti-imperialist rhetoric, which suggests a leaning towards far-left or radical left ideologies."

The Zionists have made them refugees, ignore resolutions they said they would do like giving the Palestinian refugees the right to go back home, destroyed their newly constructed homes, polluted their drinking water, controlled their movements, shoved the elderly down stairs, beaten them inside their own places of worship, made \u201cbreaking bones\u201d a policy, shot and killed their children, shooting the joints to make lifelong suffering, using deadly force at peaceful protests, used heavy machinery to crush people, restricted their food, legally detained them without cause for indefinite periods of time, forced their way into homes in the middle of the night to arrest minors terrifying the sleeping family, literally torturing the wrongfully held detainees, denying entrance and exit through the vast network of military checkpoints without just cause, intimidating and abusing the population publicly knowing full well they can\u2019t defend themselves\u2026 \u201cor else\u201d, armed settlers barging into Palestinian\u2019s homes in the middle of the night threatening to kill them if they don\u2019t abandon their own property, illegally building cities on Palestinian land, destroyed their airport, cut down ancient olive trees, spraying skunk water on them and at homes breaking windows with the spray and soaking the inside of targeted and untargeted residential homes, using them as human shields making them enter homes first before the Zionists raid, damage and destroy water holding tanks, spitting at them in the streets\u2026 all because they want the land to be occupied by Jews only. Curious how you would handle that type of constant assault? What would you do? And don\u2019t say what you wouldn\u2019t do. Fr, what would you do??"

                "content": "\n\nThe \"Mandate for Leadership\" is a set of policy proposals authored by the Heritage Foundation, an influential ultra conservative think tank. Project 2025 is a revision to that agenda tailored to a second Trump term. It would give the President unilateral powers, strip civil rights, worker protections, climate regulation, add religion into policy, outlaw \"porn\" and much more. The MFL has been around since 1980, Reagan implemented 60% of its recommendations, Trump 64% - proof. 70 Heritage Foundation alumni served in his administration or transition team. Project 2025 is quite extreme but with his obsession for revenge he'll likely get past 2/3rd's adoption.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation already writes bills for Republicans to submit. That's how there have been over 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills submitted to states since January 1st, 2024. They're the ones writing these bills and getting the GOP to pass them. They were also the ones who wrote Texas's pornography ID law that was passed. They have been behind abortion, contraception, and anti-drug laws, too. And Harrison Butker? They were the ones who sponsored him up on stage as Butker works with them frequently. And let\u2019s not also forget that The Heritage Foundation has frequent confrences that showers GOP politicians with lavish gifts while teaching them how to create right-wing propaganda and craft bills against LGBTQ+ people, abortion, and everything else.\n\nThere is no \"might\". It will happen. The Heritage Foundation controls the GOP.\n\nThere's always a right-winger trying to make people think Project 2025 is no big deal. No, it's not just a think tank, it's The Heritage Foundation. They have massive influence over right-wing politicians. Ronald Reagan took direction from them, and Donald Trump let them pick his administration. Betsy DeVos, Mick Mulvaney, Rick Perry, Scott Pruitt, and Jeff Sessions were some of the people they picked.\n\nBack in 2022, The Heritage Foundation completely reversed its position on helping Ukraine. Most Republicans followed suit. They have a lot of power and a lot of Republicans licking their boots. It's definitely something to worry about.\n\n\nHere are all the connections between Project 2025 and Trump statements.\n\nChristian Nationalism\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/09/us/evangelicals-trump-christianity.html\n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-says-hell-defend-christianity-from-radical-left-that-seek-to-tear-down-crosses\n\nhttps://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-end-church-restrictions-politics-1234728218/\n\nCanceling Climate Change\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/markjoyella/2022/03/21/on-fox-donald-trump-calls-climate-change-a-hoax-in-the-1920s-they-were-talking-about-global-freezing/\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-climate-change-global-warming-b2459167.html\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/09/14/912799501/i-don-t-think-science-knows-visiting-fires-trump-denies-climate-change\n\nControl of the Federal Government\n\nhttps://newrepublic.com/post/174370/inside-trump-fascist-plan-control-federal-agencies-wins\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2019-04-23/trump-seeks-more-control-of-fed-sec-and-other-agencies\n\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/finance/324408-the-19-federal-agencies-trump-wants-to-eliminate/\n\nUse the DoJ and FBI to arrest critics and opponents\n\nhttps://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/trump-has-threatened-dozens-of-times-to-use-the-government-to-target-political-enemies/\n\nFire the Civil Service\n\nhttps://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2024/0507/trump-biden-schedule-f-civil-service\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-plan-gut-civil-service-triggers-pushback-by-unions-democrats-2023-12-22/\n\nhttps://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/10/donald-trump-civil-servants-schedule-f\n\nReplace civil servants with loyalists\n\nhttps://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/08/03/distressing-republicans-eyeing-2024-race-support-plot-purge-federal-workers\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-civil-servants-plan-loyalists-b2132020.html\n\nhttps://www.project2025.org/personnel/\n\nMass Deportations\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2024/05/01/politics/trump-immigration-what-matters/index.html\n\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/Politics/closer-donald-trumps-2024-vow-deport-millions-migrants/story?id=110469177\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyxSA_udawk\n\nMake abortion illegal\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/trump-gay-marriage-abortion-supreme-court/index.html\n\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/09/16/abortion-rights-line-if-trump-administration-gets-4-more-years/5779444002/\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/health-donald-trump-ap-top-news-politics-election-2020-1210f9012eec9818b25ac9abad46b955\n\nCanceling transgender rights\n\nhttps://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-attacks-transgender-rights-video-1234671967/\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/us/politics/donald-trump-transgender-protections.html\n\nhttps://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article277322158.html\n\n\nCommenting this for visibility.

Proposed cuts and restructuring within the DOJ, FBI, and DHS aim to undermine checks and balances, risking civil rights protections and national security.\n\nThe push for militarizing domestic policing and invoking the Insurrection Act threatens to suppress lawful dissent and erode fundamental liberties like free speech and peaceful assembly. Economic policies favoring tax cuts and deregulation for the wealthy, particularly the fossil fuel sector, will widen the wealth gap and jeopardize environmental health.\n\nThe planned elimination of the Department of Education in favor of state control could deepen educational inequalities, while school choice policies undermine public education. Efforts to restrict reproductive rights and roll back protections for LGBTQ+ individuals reveal a broader assault on civil liberties.\n\nHarsh immigration controls prioritize punitive measures over human rights, and limiting scientific funding to ideologically aligned projects threatens innovation and progress. In sum, Project 2025's agenda poses a grave threat to democracy, civil rights, social equity, and scientific advancement, necessitating a robust and critical opposition to safeguard the future of a just society."

If the Democrats were worried, they would be rallying everyone around some great leaders and their own great policies to counter 2025. If Republicans were evil fascists, then the correct strategy would be scorched earth undermining every bit of Republican power. Instead we have Democrats crafting nearly identical policies and actively trying to lose the presidency by running Biden. They don't seem particularly worried for people who supposedly are going to be put in prison if they lose."

Even if we defeat the GQP in 2024, they will continue to try and steal power away while Democrats do nothing, and it will become Project 2027, & project 2029, and on until they win. By the way. Digging in and fighting tooth and nail against the state is just what we do as leftists, it does not constitute a plan or strategy.\nIf we don't have a revolution ourselves the country, this country will fall to fascism. It's a matter of time at this point.\n\n\nThe only plan I have seen worth any salt is a General Strike. One planned around having a minimum number of people signed on so it has the capacity to work. However that movement is also still building and at least a few years away from having critical mass to be effective. If the GQP win in 2025, the crack down could make organizing this plan difficult, if not impossible and a new strategy would be needed. We are very fractured and on the brink of fascism. No matter what I am gonna fight. That said we are facing a monstrous opponent. We cannot win without a strategy.\n\n\nIf your interested in the general strike check out Generelstrikeus.com or Strikeforourrights.org and sign up. GSUS organizes on discord, is a  very flat organization, and has more membership. Though it can be very chaotic. S4OR has a lot less members but a bit more structure to it. GSUS is the far better bet if you want to organize locally, we need folks to help build local chapters."

No one saw Paul Ryan\u2019s big tax breaks for the wealthy and tax increases for the middle and lower class coming, and no one in WI knew Walker was going to decimate public unions, public education, and sell off public lands when they voted for them. Their policies are unpopular so they lie.\n\nI believe project 2025 is going forward if trump is elected and it scares the living shit out of me. The Supreme Court is full of activist judges so the checks and balances aren\u2019t there, and todays assassination attempt (which I don\u2019t condone) is going to be used to manufacture consent to further their fascist/authoritarian agenda."

He also has a tendency to open his mouth and piss off everyone within listening distance which isn't great when war tensions are the highest they've been in my lifetime.\n\nAt this point I'm basically resigned to the fact that WWIII is inevitable, the only difference is what side we're going to end up stuck on.

That\u2019s why he hasn\u2019t taken the ceasefire talks seriously because he knows if he puts it off and trump wins he has carte Blanche. If biden wins again and we continue with the international pressure oh trust Biden will fold like a deck of cards. Trump does not care about our international standing. Biden does. The continued protests will wear on Biden after he assumes his second term and I think we will get that ceasefire. Some countries might even sanction us and Israel if this continues much longer and there\u2019s enough pressure. Trump will not care about that, Biden will. Also the only way to get the US to sanction Israel is through public outcry. Look at how Trump responds to protest vs Biden. Trump will just have the national guard bulldoze the protesters. Martyrs are great back in the day but these days I feel a lot of protestors who have died for our current causes (cop city, George Floyd, school shootings) have died in vain."

Israel does not get any direct economic aid from the US.  \nIsrael does not really have free healthcare. People pay for their healthcare as public health insurance is mandatory. And people also take up private insurance as well.  \n Unlike the US, Israel negotiates drug prices to the same levels that other nations in Europe and the rest of the Middle East pay so it is affordable.  \n If the US refuses to do this ,that is their domestic issue.   \nBut Israeli healthcare is fully paid by the people both via public insurance and private insurance.  \nAustralia has a similar medical health system to Israel and no one accuses them of being funded by the US   \nWelfare in Israel is very low by developed nations standards, including the US.  It is in fact [the worst](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-12-28/ty-article/.premium/israels-poverty-rate-is-among-the-highest-in-the-developed-world-new-report-shows/0000018c-b055-d45c-a98e-bb5d02af0000) in the OECD nations. There are no food stamps in Israel (though cash transfers exist) and to qualify for them is difficult. Heck even the Haredim who are the poorest demographic in Israel struggle to get those cash transfers even under the current right wing government. Those cash transfers are not enough to even cover the basic cost of living which is why even amongst the Haredim ,the women work and even amongst the poor Arabs and the Jews in the periphery, you cannot live on those cash transfers.  \nYour ignorance of Israel is astounding."

Attempts to subvert the judiciary were met with protests and did not go through (maybe only yet). For now Israel is not fascist.\n\nYes I'm generalizing the Palestinians. It's tragic what Hamas has done to them and it's tragic that they are suffering for Hamas' actions. On the other hand, they elected them and there are reports that Hamas has 80% support. There is no Palestinian party or organization that can be a peace partner. Netanyahu is indeed terrible, but he's nothing compared to Hamas. He's no obstacle to peace compared to a Jihadist terrorist organization that murders anyone who opposes them. Look up the definition of fascism and see which side it applies to."

Britain later did the same in the Bengal Famine ) \n\n\n\nAnd not a lie.

The author's criticism of taxing citizens to build stadiums for billionaires and millionaires playing games is a critique of government favoritism towards the wealthy, which aligns with libertarian sentiments about limited government intervention in economic matters. However, some comments also express more radical views, such as nationalizing sports leagues or abolishing professional sports altogether, which lean more towards authoritarian or socialist ideas. But overall, the tone and sentiment of the post itself is more focused on critiquing government overreach and favoritism towards the wealthy, rather than advocating for a complete overhaul of society.",

That of course is a complete fairy tale.\n\nThe reality is that capitalism promotes a society that advantages the most ruthless, amoral and cynical characters, people like Gates, Musk, Bezos, the Koch brothers, etc., etc. Who will inevitably employ their wealth to take control of the political system, which then becomes a tool to increase their own wealth and power, at the expense of everyone else.\n\nA humane, caring, just and environmentally sustainable society is not possible under capitalism. So the long term goal should be to replace it with a new form of socialism that eschews large, inefficient bureaucracies, onerous taxation and the stifling of individual initiative, but still embraces the idea of community, cooperation and a government that works for the benefit of all its citizens.\n\nThe short-term goal should be to revise the American political system in a way that empowers ordinary people, and subtracts power from the corporate elite and ultra-wealthy. This obviously wouldn't be easy, but nonetheless I believe it's doable with a coordinated effort."

Only through scientific experiments and the peoples needs should laws be passed as well.( as much as possible ofc) \n\nWe also need to go against this social pressure to reproduce for it creates a lot of problems when it comes to the abuility to have an abortion. We need a humanity which allows humans a comfortable and safe lifex which can not be controled by the whims of other groups that seek social control for the sake of outdated agendas which might only have some validity if we were on the brink of extinction.\n\nIt will be a slow process, but we can learn tk enjoy the daily research, the daily philosophising, the daily creativity of trying to figure out better ways to do things on all fronts.\nI think regular people give themselves too little credit, but they can otherwise philosophise a lot of great ideas if they gave themselves the chance to.\n\nAlso to go against comparing eachother through status symbols and by who has more money, or who is better who is worst. All thats needed is an attitude of learnibg and adaptation, and for that there is no need to compare ourselves with people, but to compare what we make with other creations in order to find ways to have ours be useful, reguardless if its the most useful or not, as long as it is in fact useful.\n\n\nTo simplify all of this for the sake of practicality \n1. Take yourown pace, work with what you have \n2. Learn, research, test, theorise, philosophise, analise, observe\n3. Teach, propagate, be compassionate \n4. Create things, for fun and otherwise, entertain yourself and others, find whats lovely about life for you and share it with others so they can have hope for a better future too \n5. Dont beat yourself up, we are only humans, we can only do as much as we have potencial, guilt, shame and the rest will only stifle most of us, instead, if you made a mistake, just try your best next time and move on \n\n\nThats how i look at things, and it keeps me able to think more or less reasonably, and able to use myown capabuilities in order to deal with the problems humanity is facing. We all have our own special skillsets, and none of us can do everything, so follow your muses, and if you are consistent and try to inovate whenever you can, than you will surely reach societally useful conclusions at some point.\n\nI do think however that no matter who we are, no matter what we are interested in, learning and creating a solid philosophy, with a good epistemology is the key for enabling socuetal change.\nWe humans have focused so much on technology but not enough on society. \nNot that we havent, but that we havent implemented all that has been made already, and we havent enabled the majority of people to understand that philosophy is not just for intelectual types, but its for every human beeing, and besides what we need to survive it is the foundation for everything in human society, period.\n\n\nSo my final attempt at simplifying is \" compassionately try to fuel yourown and others flames for curiosity & learning of moral and scientific philosophy\" \n\nHave a lovely day"

Learn to learn \n\n1. To educate ourselves on the scientific method, formal logic, moral philosophy and epistemology, for learning and for determining fir ourselves what is the moral\n\n2. To learn comunications skills, to be able to propagandise and educate people on the topics of how to use the scientific method in their daily lives, how to use formal logic & how to philosophise \n\n3. To learn some psychology in order for us to have the skills necessery to regulate our own intelect with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), & to regulate our emotions with dialectical behavuoural therapy.\n\n4. Learn about nutrition, exercise, sleep and such topics \n\n5. Learn wildernes survival skills, cooking, and every daily skill we need around the house\n\n6. Learn art, music and writing in order to entertain ones self and to explore broader more farther reaching ideas than what makes sence, what is normal, what is concrete \n\n7. Learn how to teach people and how to adapt to their learning styles, and teach them things not in any forceful way but through interaction in entertaining ways if possible\n\n8. Follow your interests, take your own pace\n\n9. Socialise and build social nets \n\n\u2014 with all of thease skills combined, i believe that we as individuals will be more able to figure out what we need to do at any given moment."

Im not one to think that we need it all figured out before we can act.\nHowever, beeing able to better understand ideology and  morality will enable us to figure out the end of our actions and the acceptable means through which we may acheive them.\nKnowing how to learn faster will enable us to adapt faster.\n     Having skills to manage emotions will enable us to take care of our mental health allowng the way through any obsticals we may face. \nHaving social nets will make it easier for us to have opertunities and to spread messages that are necessary for societal progress, as well as the fact that we might need help personally, and people might need our help as well.\n    Having basic life skills, thats self explanetory.\nHaving art skills is for getting rid of our potencial mental riggidity, cuz you know, sometimes we just get cemented in bad ideas and we keep going and going, so thats kind of a way to get us to a broader perspective of life.\n    Comunication skills are good to have in order to be an effecrive comunicator. So oftain i see people who end up beeing condescending, and ineffective in their attempt to teach someone about an idea, and when it comes to trying to educate people on political issues, we cant afford to only talk to those we already aguree with, and we have to try to bersuade those who are not on our side, since many of them will enevitably be against us only because of lack of education, and besides this, we cant win if we stay stagnant in our numbers whille the people spreading regressive politics keep growing.\n    The initial thing i said about philosophy is also for beeing able to defend ourown arguments well enough, because i also see many people who lose faith in the ideas for a better future that the left has simply because they themselves didnt quite understand why leftists think what we do. \n  Knowing about sleep, nutrition and exercise is something which can improve our qhality of life, our mood, our abuility to think and to do, so its an overall great for our own quality of life. We are living beeings after all and we need to bottom line have a good life for ourselves as well, and besides that, beeing burnt out doesent help our cause anyway, since we will be less effective.\nThe ruling class counts on us beeing overworked, with mental health issues, with financial problems, stressed out and tired, since if we have all those things, than when will we have the time, energy or motivation to be activists, to help others, to have great ideas, to educate ourselves and others? \nSo in the spirit of that, i think that we will have a great advantage if we used whatever resources we have in order to overtime, at ourown individual pace, learn and practise all of thease skills mentioned ( ofc, they will vary somewhat from person to person and thats all natural) \n\n\nAnd finally, we must all remember that just because we cant solve a problem, it does not make us failures.\nNone of the problems we are aiming to solve on a societal scale can be done alone, so dont burden yourselves with a notion that you have to be as productive as possible in order to be worthy as a human beeing ; its enough that you are trying what is within yourown power ( and really, that is all that any of us can do ) \n\nHave a wonderful day"

After becoming pregnant by him she shot him while he was trying to climb in a back window to rape her again. She then cut off his head. \n\nHonor is huge in these small villages and he had taken pictures of her naked and pregnant while sleeping also.\n\nHe got what he had coming to him. \n\nIt is tragic that she is now imprisoned for this imo."

I am about 4 years separated from an abusive marriage.\n\nIn the final year that we were living together, it was very well understood between us both that the marriage was over.  Her behavior had pushed our son to attempt suicide, and I was long-overdue ending it as it was necessary at that point to save his life.  Our home life for a couple years had mostly been everyone locking themselves in their respective rooms and interacting as little as possible.  We had not been sleeping in the same room for around 5 years, and only had sex once in that same timespan.\n\nOne night somewhere in that last year we were still living together she came home drunk, and very aggressive about getting into my pants.  I gave her the coldest of cold shoulders.  Zero reciprocation.  I got up and moved away from her several times.  She just followed and kept pushing herself on me.  She was extremely volatile around that time, and I worried what she might do if I gave a hard no, left the house or locked myself in a room.  Start a domestic altercation that could result in me getting arrested?  Take her anger out on our son?  So I relented.\n\nConsidering I only allowed it to happen out of fear of the potential consequences of more forceful rejection, and she did not have my lukewarm consent, much less enthusiastic, I would expect that if this community is ideologically consistent, this would be considered rape.\n\nSo would this community also cheer if I shot her 10 times, cut her head off, and threw it in front of a bunch of people?  Or would it suddenly be a delicate matter of nuance."

Perhaps dangerous for a functional society to approve of, but not necessarily wrong or unjustified on her part.  There's very little information here (it doesn't even say ignored by police - only that she was refused an abortion).\n\nBut as a very online leftist since the mid-90's, my experience in leftist spaces, overwhelmingly so in the last 10 years, is that it's not about that.  The applause would be the same regardless of the details, so long as the perpetrator is male, the victim is female, and the word rape is applicable by any interpretation.\n\nReading through the comments, I see almost nothing but hard-line blanket declarations that rapists cannot be rehabilitated, it's what all rapists deserve, etc.  Not rapists who rape multiple times.  Not violent rapists.  Not rapists who blackmail or get their victims pregnant.  Just rapists.  Rapist is a very broad term.  I wanted to demonstrate that.  And I know from ample experience that crowds like this recognize zero nuance wherever the R word is concerned.  If a women shared a story like mine, she'd get the same energy.  I've seen it many times.  But as soon as I, as a man, share that story, that energy leaves the room, and that has really disturbing implications for me that has prompted me to remove myself from leftist spaces almost entirely over the last few years.  I've come to see very clearly that it's not about the rape, it's about who the rapist is."

That's probably the only line of reasoning one could use to argue that the killing was unjust. I don't believe there's any merit to that agreement in this case. \n\n\nThe desecration of the corpse however is pretty much clear as day, she chopped his head off, took it outside, threw it on the ground, and started screaming about why she did it. It would be hard to argue that she wasn't in a mental state where she was aware of what she was doing since she explained why she did it during the incident. \n\n\nHowever, if I was on the jury I would acquit her of the desecration charge as well.

But at some point we need actual passion on the left too, and not just a bunch of naysayers.\n\nTo your specific question on healthcare, insurance companies being a long standing leech that is built into the system is not a reason for people to keep forking over thousands a year for partial coverage and healthcare costs 10x higher than the next closest country. This is similar to how the IRS has spent 40 years refusing to provide a direct, free, filing service - to protect the jobs of tax service companies. I think most would agree this is stupid.

I do not dispute in the slightest that my story is not comparable.  But I'm sharing it to criticize a cultural attitude that insists on making the subject about men.  It shouldn't be about men.  But it becomes about men when it only triggers rabid bloodlust when the perpetrator is a man, or people believe that only men are rapists.\n\nIf I didn't see that attitude on display here, I wouldn't bring up my general experiences.  But I had already gathered a sampling of other posts in this thread literally right next to where you just commented as examples of people here doing that, which align with my general experiences in leftist spaces.\n\nI see these same comments when the story is less horrible (more like mine), but still a male perpetrator.  I do not see these same comments when the story is horrible, but a female perpetrator.  Heck, I've seen Donna Hylton brought up in leftist spaces multiple times, and not a single instance of anyone in those spaces suggesting she should be dead.\n\nI don't think it should be difficult to understand why that would be disturbing to me?\n\nEdit:  I can see how you could be labeling it insensitive to choose this specific occasion as an opportunity to criticize leftist culture, because it's about a victim.  But the victim isn't present.  I wouldn't say anything like this if they were.

They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike the incarcerated, addicted, or the chronically poor; they don\u2019t resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct; unlike widows, they don\u2019t ask you to question patriarchy; unlike orphans, they don\u2019t need money, education, or childcare; unlike aliens, they don\u2019t bring all that racial, cultural, and religious baggage that you dislike; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. It\u2019s almost as if, by being born, they have died to you. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus but actually dislike people who breathe.\r  \n\r  \nPrisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn."

It\u2019s their lives and their bodies. \n\nHOWEVER. Let\u2019s be objective here for a moment and be honest. Even if we don\u2019t agree with the morals or ideas of others. The pro life people ( of which there are more than most would like to admit)believe that abortion is the killing of a baby. And objectively. It is. So their stance on abortion could be summarized as:\n\nAdults have free will and can do what they want. They can choose to engage in high risk sexual activity (yes. I know about rape and incest, those can be discussed in another sidebar) at their own discussion. They have the ability to take accountability for their own actions. A baby from day 1 to the end of gestation does not have a say. Or free will. Their objection that protecting a voiceless human being is critically important. And even though I don\u2019t necessarily agree with them. I can see merit to their point. \n\nI have an issue when women choose to use abortion as a means to engage in more high risk activity. Planned parenthood and local community health centers provide access to condoms and other birth control. \n\nI would ask the question of today\u2019s society of why are we so unwilling to take accountability for our actions and plan ahead. Or be thoughtful. If you are going to engage in any sexual activity, wear a condom. Or abstain on the absence of protection. Demand that men use protection. Women are the gatekeepers of sex. If they enforce safe standards, unwanted pregnancies would be a lot less. \n\nLet\u2019s better educate low income and disparaged communities about the resources available to them and stop celebrating hookup culture and free love. \n\nI know I\u2019m going to get torched for this. But it is possible to disagree with someone on a topic and still see merit to their side of the argument."

We\u2019re being punished right now because we voted in the first black (half*) president in U.S. history. Smh. I left Yemen at age 7 (US Citizen), because my dad thought life and education would be better here (following a civil war 1995-1997). He was right. These right wing nuts remind me a lot of the nuts who ruined life for everyone back in the Middle East. In the 60s and 70s life in the Middle East was amazing, women were free, education was great. Right wing nuts helped ruin that too, not directly, but they helped. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m seeing a slightly similar pattern here in the U.S. Which I know Putin and China are loving.  1998 I feel like was the height of American life (I know I was a preteen back then) we were in a surplus, my parents were able to buy a home and give us a good life with no degrees. My mom barely spoke English. Can\u2019t believe Clinton was impeached over a blowjob or even lying about it, and now we have Trump in court for an objectively worse reason and those same people think there\u2019s no case and it\u2019s all BS. I feel like I we got sucked into some weird parallel universe. How is this ass hat Cheeto clown the hill they all wanna die on. How are they ok with him wanting to be a dictator (like we ran away from in Yemen) when they\u2019re blessed with so much freedom and opportunity. Makes me sad as fuck, my dad is retired in Yemen now and his small SSA check allows him to live very comfortably even though life there is so unpredictable\u2026 but his lifestyle and lack of stress makes me kinda wanna go back, but I can\u2019t. I grew up here in Detroit for 80% of my life, I get by thank goodness but it\u2019s been getting harder and harder. I\u2019m so sorry about the rant, but this more is the best way to vent and unload and sometimes peoples responses are really eye opening. I hope we get our act together and make this place great for future generations and ourselves while we\u2019re here. Assholes like Ted Cruz shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near public service jobs period.

Never seen a conservative make sacrifices to help the needy either, outside of the deeply religious. Most liberals are self righteous cunts for sure, but criticizing liberals from the right is kinda a pot calling the kettle black type situation. Almost everything that is broken, wrong, and stupid about liberalism as a political ideology (and there are a lot of broken wrong and stupid things) can be applied to conservatives and libertarians equally. Imperialism and endless war? Check. Government that prioritizes the luxury of the few over the needs of the many? Check. Politician worship? Check. Endless political corruption? Check. No concept of political ideology? Check. Blindness to systemic issues? Check. Endless hypocrisy? Check. Most self described conservatives are just liberals who are slightly more honest about how much contempt they have for the working class. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally I consider conservatism and modern American libertarians to be model examples of liberalism. There is no actual difference between these two and self described liberals beyond the issues of gun rights and abortion. Liberals pretend to care about other issues a bit more, but they really don't give a shit. Look at how \"outraged\" liberals were about kids in concentration camps under Trump, and now that they have taken over they no longer give a shit and have opened even more \"detention facilities for minors seeking asylum\".  I bet Biden is going to send troops in to \"put the uppity n\\*\\*\\*\\*rs in their place\" too before his first term is up. Classic liberalism. The media just lies to the voters and pretends like there is a huge difference so that people don't consider any options beyond the democrats and republicans who are controlled by the same masters. That's why all the policy differences between the two sides don't really have a material impact on the elite. They keep us fighting over things that divide us but don't prevent them from continuing to exploit us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nVoting does nothing. The only options for liberation are those that can't be discussed here."

You'll say something stupid like all left-wing ideology is a slippery slope to stalinism or something stupid.  You completely dismiss ideologies such as democratic socialism, anarchism, mutualism, sydicalism, social democracy, trotskyism, social libertarianism.  But if you meet a leftist who subscribes to that ideology you'll just call them a communist (as if there aren't many breeds of communist) and that just means authoritarian in your stupid brain.  Your ignorance to political ideology and using logical fallacies as rhetoric isn't an argument."

Perhaps congress saw a way to place a him in power and keep their thumb on him by basically finding him not guilty for the rape of Anita Hill when he was undergoing questioning during his confirmation hearing in 1991. By doing this, they are able to control his decisions. By buying him lavish gifts and such, they maintain his silence. Is that why SCOTUS changed their rules to allow for gifts?"

Their dishonest rhetoric and messaging as well as their work to obstruct or block legislation the larger whole of Black and minority voters work towards to build our communities makes them tokens and they deserve no respect for it.

If they kill civilians / non targets it doesn\u2019t matter bc they\u2019re not at risk of backlash from the population. When they destroy buildings, roads, airports etc it doesn\u2019t matter bc they don\u2019t need those things & wont have to repair them. \n\nIf they bomb their own civilians they will be completely outnumbered & surrounded on literally all sides by potential combatants. \n\nIf they bomb a road they will need to pay to re build it, if they bomb a neighbourhood they will need to pay to rebuild it, if they bomb literally anything *they will need to pay to rebuild it.* \n\nThey will not be able to utilize the full strength of their military within their own borders it\u2019s as simple as that. \n\nNot only that there is the morale issue; any time an invading force faces a resistance force there is a problem- invading forces have no reason to attack other than they were told to & the commitment to \u201cbc I was told to\u201d varies heavily person to person. The resistance force however has a very solid motivation \u201cthis is our home & our families & we will not lose them.\u201d Every small victory by the resistance force hammers the invaders with \u201cwhy are we here? Why are we doing this?\u201d \n\nNow add to that the resistance force is literally the invading forces neighbours, family, friends etc. \n\nYou mythologize the US too much. They\u2019re not an infallible god army that will raze anything they touch. They lose, not infrequently either & not often by more technologically advanced forces."

You realize they were regular working class people right? Like not trained super soldiers, just regular proletariat who didn\u2019t want to be invaded. \n\n> You will never be able to do what they did. And also every successful asymmetric war relies on more than those farmers in sandals. Framing it that way simplifies guerilla war so far as to have no hope of understanding it.\n\nI was exaggerating to make a point. The US domestically has better weapons than Afghanistan & Vietnam, more of them, & a population more well trained in using them. The US has plenty of forest/desert/rural land to hide out on. All the major routes of travel the govt /military will take will be well known by the population bc they live here & know which freeways will be the fastest/most efficient. There is internet access in nearly every corner of the US so communication & organization will be infinitely easier. There is such a massive surplus of food in the US, there\u2019s farms, grocery stores, corner stores, markets, all that could be looted by guerilla forces for supplies. The US citizens will be familiar with all of the points of interest for the govt; military base locations are online, military store houses are online, the location of arms factory\u2019s are online, the White House, the capital both online. The pentagon; online. This is all on top of the fact if the US military attacked its own citizens it would be infinitely easier to get double agents inside the military bc they\u2019re literally related to & neighbours with the people they\u2019re supposed to be killing. \n\nIf you want more modern examples the IRA used violence & terror attacks to achieve spots in parliament & their path to freedom from British oppression came to a screeching halt after they disarmed. \n\nYou\u2019re literally buying the govt propaganda. They want you to believe you have no chance so you submissively continue voting for Biden or whatever Blue sociopath they put in front of you that cycle."

The image and comments suggest a left-leaning perspective, with many commenters criticizing the idea that some people \"deserve\" more than others based on their individual merit or circumstances. The tone is critical of capitalist ideals and the notion that some individuals are inherently more deserving of wealth and privilege than others. Overall, the post seems to advocate for greater economic equality and a more socialist approach to societal organization, which aligns with a libertarian-left position.",
        "left_to_right_rating": "I'd rate this post as -5.\n\nThe image and accompanying text appear to be satirical commentary on societal attitudes towards work, wealth, and power, with a clear leaning towards socialist or anarchist ideology. The comments section reflects this, with most users expressing agreement with the meme's message of advocating for higher wages and better working conditions, while also criticizing conservative or nationalist perspectives as being rooted in a fear of economic competition and a desire to maintain privilege.\n\nThe tone of the comments is overwhelmingly progressive, with many users pointing out the absurdity of conservatives' reactions to the idea of workers demanding fair treatment. The language used by commenters is varied, but most seem to be advocating for some form of wealth redistribution or greater social equality.\n\nOverall, the post's tone and content suggest a strong leaning towards light left politics (-4), with many users expressing support for progressive policies and criticizing conservative ideologies."

It's embarrassing. I'll concede that maybe there's something in the rest of the article, but this excerpt does not represent a justification for murdering Palestinian children. \n\nThe part of the article that can be seen for free seems to be setting up an argument against the UN's revised, lower death toll. If that's the case, then the Atlantic would seem to be concerned that the UN isn't taking the deaths of Palestinian children seriously enough. To me, that's the opposite of a justification for murdering children. \n\nIn 2023, [The Atlantic wrote that](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/10/unicef-cost-gaza-war-children/675780/):\n\n\"The true cost of the violence in Gaza and Israel will be measured in children\u2019s lives\u2014those lost to the violence and those forever changed by it.\n\n\"Less than three weeks on from the horrific attack inside Israel and the start of daily bombings of the Gaza Strip, the devastating tally in Israel and Gaza is quickly adding up. More than 2,700 Palestinian children have been killed and nearly 6,000 injured, according to Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health, for a shocking average of more than 480 child casualties per day.\"\n\nAgain, this doesn't sound like a publication that is devaluing children's lives. \n\nSo, yes, I'll concede that maybe there's some devastating condemnation of the Atlantic in the parts of the article you have to pay to access. But based on the text we have available here, I'll say that the left needs to do better than this."

How collateral is it? They don't particularly want it to happen, but they won't do anything to avoid it if they can get at a target of military value, and they know that if they are going to make war on Hamas, avoiding the death of children is a statistical impossibility. How very collateral indeed.\n\nNow here's some bad news for you righteously indignant souls .\n\n\nHamas kills children and call it collateral damage. How collateral is it? They don't particularly want it to happen, but they won't do anything to avoid it if they can get at a target of military value, and they know that if they are going to make war on Hamas, avoiding the death of children is a statistical impossibility.\n\nOnly  that isn't true. Hamas does not attack targets of military value, they do not accept the concept of civilian Israelis, arguing that since the Israeli citizen is subject to conscription, all Israelis are combatants. This flies in the face of \"hors de combat\" but who really cares? So it turns out Hamas picks targets and children die because Hamas isn't willing to alter its target assignments explicitly to avoid child casualties.\n\nSo we are quite well lost in the brush of theory and doctrine trying to find a distinction. In functional terms there is none between the way they conduct warfare.\n\nThe only distinction at all is the fact that Israel has a far greater capacity to inflict violence on Hamas than Hamas can on Israel. Or put it another way, Israel can absolutely drop more bombs on Hamas than Hamas can on Israel."

Hamas' only successful invasion of Israel was a terrible event. Every last participant in that raid should be hunted down and shot. Israel's response has been exponentially more brutal. Why does it seem like you don't feel that way? \n\nSince (not including) October 7th 262 Israelis have been killed in this conflict. 260 soldiers and 2 civilians. *2 civilians*. Both adults. That's collateral damage. Israel is intentionally targeting buildings and areas they know to be heavily populated, mostly with women and children, whether or not you acknowledge that their intent is to kill civilians. That's a war crime. I'm not arguing that Hamas is in the right, but your assertion that \"they both kill children and call it collateral damage\" is super disingenuous. Hamas lobs an unsuccessful missile at Israel, Israel blows up a hospital full of civilians. \n\n\nStop trying to make them equivalent to make it easier to justify Israel's abhorrent behavior. If Israel wanted to go in and remove Hamas from power the right way they'd have had the support of the entire Western world. Instead they've decided to obliterate the entire infrastructure of millions of people and kill 10s of thousands of innocent civilians. To put it into perspective, Israel has killed, conservatively, about 6% of the entire civilian death toll in the entirety of the war on terror. The 2 decade war on terror spanning several large countries. They've killed that many civilians just in Gaza. Just in the last 8 months."

Its ALSO fighting in one of the most dense urban areas in the world with one of the highest per capita population densities.\n\nTheres more nuance and context than many of guys are willing to accept because it doesnt fit your narrative.\n\nAny army, in any conflict since the dawn of civilization, in an urban area, is going to kill shitloads of civilians.\n\nLeningrad, Berlin, Metz, Dusseldorf, Teiping, Konigsberg. Those battles alone account for nearly a million civilian deaths. And thats with bombs and shells and bullets that are dramatically less powerful than whats used today. (A .308 or 9mm rifle round is more powerful than a 5.56 but it also wont be lethal for nearly the same distance)\n\nWhen the Russians were in the Seelowe Heights, fighting towards Berlin, only small numbers of soldiers were committing wanton killings of civilians. However almost 50,000 civilians would die in the next few days, mostly from aerial bombardment and artillery.\n\nThats just how war is fought. And it was fought against old men and children at this point, with barely functioning equipment, because thats all that was left to defend Berlin. The Soviet army didnt stop just because the Germans were fighting with sticks and stones. \n\nAnd perhaps Hamas should have thought about the fact that they have ultra lights, rpgs and rifles, to defend against modern equipment, before they kidnapped and murdered a bunch of people.\n\nIt doesnt make what Israel is doing right, Israel is wrong too, but this is the very predictable outcome of war in a place that has like 300 people for every 40 square meters.\n\nWhile there ARE war crimes and murders happening, Ive also watched you guys lose your shit over completely acceptable conduct in war.\n\nIf you are being shot at from a building that contains civilians, that building is going to be destroyed, whether or not there are civilians there. Every single army on Earth is going to make that call. Every one. Your brother, your father, your son, anyone in any military on Earth is going to destroy that building, and kill those civilians, to get the one guy shooting at you.\n\nIts not a playground. You dont go shoot him with a stun gun or set up a perimeter of police and bring in a negotiator. Its a war. You pin point it with a laser and let a guided bomb do its job.\n\nWars hell kids."

                "author": "kumaratein",
                "content": "Okay well for one let's read the whole paragraph in which the sentence is featured. The incendiary screenshot can't even give us that much: \n\n**\"To rebut Hamas\u2019s allegations by letting journalists see the war up close would be a calculated risk**. Even when conducted legally, war is ugly. It is possible to kill children legally, if for example one is being attacked by an enemy who hides behind them. But the sight of a legally killed child is no less disturbing than the sight of a murdered one.\" \n\nAnd now reading even a little bit into the story which is very clearly and explicitly about the lack of verifiable third party civilians following a UN revision of the death toll numbers: \n\n\"**Israel currently embeds zero journalists in Gaza. It isn\u2019t legally obligated to let journalists join its frontline units**. But it doesn\u2019t let journalists into Gaza independently, either. \u201cTo allow journalists to report safely,\u201d an Israeli military spokesperson told me, the Israel Defense Forces \u201caccompany them when on the battlefield.\u201d He would not say how many journalists had in fact been allowed to accompany IDF units\u2014let alone accompany them on regular operations, rather than short press tours of battle sites after the action. **When Hamas alleges that Israeli soldiers are shooting everyone in sight, and murdering families by flattening buildings devoid of military purpose, it can point to the dead children. Israel can deny the charge and hope that the world trusts it over an avowed terrorist group. The world seldom obliges**.\"\n\nOkay so now with basic reading comprehension and not immediate knee jerk off a screenshot with no context\u2014\n\n1. The world is pointing to Israel's killing of women and children as evidence of their indiscriminate killing behavior   \n2. Israel denies these numbers. But they don't let any reporters in to independently verify these numbers \u2014 WHY?   \n3. Enter the context of the line - Israel is not breaking international law by killing kids during a war. This isn't the author's opinion this is just literally a statement of fact. They literally give an example right after the highlighted line as to why this is the case. The ICC criminal charges against the IDF don't list \"killing kids\" as one of their crimes.   \n4. The crime Israel is being charged with and which has the world outrages is INDISCRIMINATE killing.   \nThis is something that can only be proven through showing WHO has died. The UN's numbers just got revised downwards by 50% and there is really no actual stable count of who has died and how many there were. Inaccurate information gives them the ability to say they are being unfairly judged by figures that the UN just confirmed over double the accurate number.   \n5. As the author states in their opening line of the article \"**The actual death toll matters\u2014first, because of the dignity of those killed or still living**.\". And most clearly in their final paragraph:\n\n\"None of this excuses OCHA, which jeopardized its credibility by repeating dubious numbers, long after the reasons for doubting them had been explained. That credibility is a precious resource. The IDF claims to have killed \u201cat least 13,000\u201d combatants\u2014lower than Netanyahu\u2019s estimate\u2014but refused to comment yesterday when I asked if it had any idea how many civilians it had killed. **The correct answer is, well,** ***a lot*****.**\u00a0\"\n\nThe author's point is never that Israel is justified, actually the oppoosite. They're saying you can't accurately hold someone to account for their crimes without accurate information, and that accurate information isn't possible because the IDF won't let in journalists. Why? Because they know how bad it will look for them to show all the dead kids EVEN if they are in legal grounds. Then when neutral agencies repeat Hamas figures which get revised downwards Israel has all it needs to keep saying \"SEE! They are using wrong figures!\" while refusing to provide their own. \n\nIt's crazy to read a full article to understand the nuance these days I know. But imagine going into a court case for murder and saying \"ya facts don't matter we know they did it\""

Low information ppl in the working class fell for rhetoric and they will deal with what comes from that.\n\nNah, this is what a specific demographic and a few others gave us, not liberals. We\u2019ve gotten comfortable just throwing words around in fits of anger.\n\nIt will never make sense watching millions of Americans choose to vote right wing, then see rants towards \u201cliberals\u201d we could call the middle compromise, try to understand how to appeal to these ppl who just voted for the right wing candidate. A candidate more right wing than what our generation is even used to seeing. Then spend tons of energy attacking the ppl who thought it made sense to meet these right wing voters in the middle.\n\nThe pendulum swings from one end to the other, you can\u2019t skip the middle to get to the other side.\nIt\u2019s hilarious. What are we talking med 4 all in a country with voters who don\u2019t even like the base level healthcare we have now? \n\nLeft of center policy is blocked in the senate, but somehow the mistake was not being far enough left. lol\n\nIt\u2019s even funnier if you\u2019re a white male leftist. That means while you didn\u2019t vote, voted for Stein, or wrote someone in, the vast majority of your demographic (neighbors, friends, family) voted for the right winger while you vilify the left of center group that pivoted to the right to get that vote. \n\nWe need to be honest about who we are.

But, they thought they could slide past with basically nothing special other than her identity and what it could mean after another year of highest cost of living we have seen possibly ever. We can see by numbers alone alot of democrat voters MUST have defected to voting for Trump likely out of desperation as I can see everyone talks about how inflation is down yet you can do price analysis of grocery store items and seen an absurd increase in percentage. I won\u2019t say her being a Black and South Asian woman wasn\u2019t a factor but there certainly could have been better work done if they really wanted to win. They indeed had nothing to throw at Trump that would promise a win for the life of the average working class American and that is where they lost the plot. I understand Trump sucks but if your only point is \u201clook how bad the other guy is\u201d and isn\u2019t \u201clook how great we are\u201d how can you expect to win over a more dedicated voter base? Another issue is the inconsistency im sure others saw. Having \u201cBiden had to inherent trumps economy!\u201d And \u201cBidens economy has been great\u201d both being parroted from the same side is idiotic."

Which is my number one criticism of electoralism as a praxis. The cast their ballots, throughout the orange shitgibbon, and thought their job was done. Now I talk to anybody about getting some real praxis going, and it's hands thrown in the air and a string of excuses. Those out there actually doing stuff? They're basically doing charity and calling it mutual aid, or throwing the occasional brief protest that doesn't go anywhere and thinking that's all that needs to be done. The concepts of dual power, force multiplication, community building, and logistics seem to be lost on them. If I try to bring them up, it's like I'm speaking a language they don't understand.\n\nI know some of it is the glamorization of protests and violence as a solution \u2014 I'm no pacifist, but most of the work that has to be done is non-violent in nature, and there just isn't the same glory and sparkle to helping the homeless, growing food, and building logistical structures as there is taking to the streets and taunting the piggies. But, even if you have some grandiose illusion of violent revolution (which is probably not going to happen), you can't even BEGIN to pull that off without building logistics and dual power structures first. Same thing with a more peaceful approach like a general strike \u2014 people aren't going to do it unless you get the logistical structures to support them during the strike in place first.\n\nIn short, people don't want to put in the work to prepare and build in order to make things happen. They want instant gratification because they are spoiled and their heads are filled with liberal nonsense. So they'd rather police the orthodoxy of other leftists in petty and useless ways rather than address real issues, internally and externally, in an effective manner."

The language used by some commenters, such as \"Fuck christians\" and \"fuck them I hate them so much\", may be seen as inflammatory but it is not advocating for authoritarian measures. Instead, it reflects a strong anti-establishment sentiment and a desire for more radical change.\n\nThe comments also express disdain for the Democratic Party's failure to represent the interests of its base, particularly on issues related to social justice and economic inequality. This critique is directed at the party's leadership and policies, rather than advocating for increased government control or authoritarianism.\n\nOverall, while some commenters may be advocating for radical change or criticizing the system in general, there is no clear call for authoritarian measures or a return to traditional hierarchical structures. The tone of the comments is more accurately described as anti-establishment and critical of the status quo, rather than advocating for increased government control.",
        "left_to_right_rating": "I will provide a rating based on the content of the post and comments. Keep in mind that this is an evaluation of the overall sentiment and tone of the discussion.\n\nRating: -4 (Light Left)\n\nThe post's title and many of the comments exhibit strong anti-liberal sentiment, but the underlying discussion revolves around critiques of the Democratic Party's policies and actions from a progressive or left-wing perspective. The comments mention issues like support for authoritarian leaders, criticism of neoliberalism, and advocacy for more radical social change. While some comments contain explicit language and personal attacks, they seem to be aimed at liberal politicians rather than advocating for extreme measures. Overall, the discussion falls within the range of light-left sentiment, as it critiques capitalist systems and advocates for progressive reforms without promoting radical socialist or communist ideologies."

You will hear excuses from liberals about why it's okay to draw an arbitrary line around humans, including strawman attacks that people like this monk are naive for not considering facts of nature and the brute realities of existence--as though they didn't realize that claws and teeth are made for fighting and biting. Of course, those who believe that we should try to minimize harm also recognize the practical impossibility of eliminating it entirely; this does not in any sense undermine the principle.\n\nThe political spectrum is defined relative to the current zeitgeist, and universally applicable ethics such as this monk's--which recognize the base unit of morality as the capacity for conscious experience--are so far outside of that discussion as to be totally alien to it. I don't think it makes sense to speak of it as \"left\" or \"right,\" not least since these views are not remotely part of public discussion that defines the political spectrum, but also since \"left\" and \"right\" are defined not just by foundational ethical principles but by ideas about how governments should be run, which are not necessarily a derivation of foundational alone ethics, but a consequence of one's beliefs about sociology, psychology, economics, etc.\n\nHowever, if we are concerned strictly with foundational ethical principles, the view expressed by the monk is most assuredly more principled than the predominant ethics of either side of the political spectrum, since it does not hinge on an arbitrary delineation around humans that philosophers and scientists have struggled to justify through centuries of failed attempts."

But I worked hard on my post so I\u2019m leaving it as it is lol\n\n\nSo here is the great divide amongst leftists. \n\nPersonally I studied communist history before learning anarchist theory. So it would be fair to call me an anarcho-communist. \n\nNon-Violence vs Armed Revolution\n\nI think both are incredibly important. Every struggle the people have made, cannot be dismissed. But still, I want to find a solution, a universal way to make the world a better place. \n\nHampton said you can\u2019t fight fire with fire. And anarchists basically say you can\u2019t fight the state with a state. \n\nThe revolution has to happen in our minds first. Those who choose the path of non-violence are inherently living revolutionary action. Because in a world full of animosity- saying I have no enemies, makes you holy. \n\nIt\u2019s the means and ends unity. The whole the road to hell is paved with good intentions- in anarchist thought that would be unacceptable. The road we pave, must always be justifiable by its means and its ends. There is no shortcut, all must move forward together. \n\nNo gods, no masters, no bosses- only us. And we\u2019re all in this together. \n\n\n[how anarchism leads to emergence](https://youtu.be/K8_S8iD9evY?si=57P9AjF7BJuUS7eZ)"

Dandelion honey in particular has all the same immune/antioxidant benefits that bee honey has.\n\n* Avoid gelatin in food and over the counter pills and drugs. Tablet form is usually safe.\n\n* Adopt don\u2019t shop. \n\n* Spread awareness about veganism (ethically, environmentally) online and in person, and volunteer for animal rights based events. This one\u2019s an important one. Your sphere of influence captures more than your individual choices, and you can have a positive impact on others.\n\n* Donate to animal rights orgs, farm animal rescues, and sanctuaries. [Animal Charity Evaluator](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/recommended-charities/) can help you figure out the best ones to contribute to.\n\n* Visit vegan restaurants - they are *always* sensitive and responsive to allergies in my experience and can make quite tasty food for most dietary sensitivities and restrictions. Calling ahead can be good to gauge how they cook (shared utensils/surfaces, contamination).\n\n* **Stressing this one:** Consult with a certified dietician (try and find a vegan one?) and tell them you want to decrease or eliminate your animal product intake and take their suggestions to heart.\n\nI feel for your allergies, but there\u2019s a lot you can do to shift your lifestyle in that direction without going totally plant based. I just pretty much summed up all of the satellite choices behind veganism that extend past diet.

The university he taught at was taken over by the government who kicked him out and labeled his closest nun, Ch\u00e2n Kh\u00f4ng a communist. He and his team continued doing relief work whole being violently attacked by the South Vietnamese government. He led a symposium in the US and was banned from returning to Vi\u1ec7t Nam.\n\nHe wasn't able to return for a long time due to the Vietnamese government being very sceptical of religion in general, and saw his work as aiding the South Vietnamese in exile. They later welcomed him back in the 2000s.\n\nI only wanted to make note that it was less of \"refused to take a side\" and more of \"he and his institutions just did the work and both hated Buddhists for not being Catholic or not being atheist\" he was against war, but had positive things to say about a new Vietnamese state."

I have no desire to fight people, and since I deny those who would otherwise wish to attack me the project they need to continue to think themselves the good guy of their story, the tendency is for most people to not attack me. \n\nThere\u2019s a great scene from season 5 of \u201cBabylon 5.\u201d In that scene, a charismatic yet nonviolent character intervenes in a fight in the rough part of the station. The character tells the gang members attempting to attack another to punch him instead with no repercussions. \n\nThey punch him three times at his request.\n\nThat character asks the puncher for an assessment of the punches. Did 1 do anything different than 3? Was 2 more forceful than 1? And did any of them make a difference in what that character did? \n\nThe gang was confused, turned around, walked away. \n\nGranted, this is interpersonal level rather than communal or societal level, but everything starts with one on one interactions."

I don\u2019t know this guys entire worldview, but from this quote and by the fact he\u2019s a Buddhist monk, I\u2019m more just answering that no- his thoughts don\u2019t fall into a leftist worldview- they fall into a Buddhist worldview. \n\nBefore finishing this comment I checked out his Wiki.  I think he\u2019s actually a great example of a leftist, but this quote and many like it, are examples of idealism.  In his actual tenets for the order of monks he founded, he does give a consistent and nuanced view.  From the wiki page on his Engaged Buddhism- I separated out the section on violence, but do check out his wiki and the wiki on his order, formatting is much better. \n\nDo not be idolatrous about or bound to any doctrine, theory, or ideology, even Buddhist ones. Buddhist systems of thought are guiding means; they are not absolute truth.\nDo not think the knowledge you presently possess is changeless, absolute truth. Avoid being narrow minded and bound to present views. Learn and practice nonattachment from views in order to be open to receive others' viewpoints. Truth is found in life and not merely in conceptual knowledge. Be ready to learn throughout your entire life and to observe reality in yourself and in the world at all times.\nDo not force others, including children, by any means whatsoever, to adopt your views, whether by authority, threat, money, propaganda, or even education. However, through compassionate dialogue, help others renounce fanaticism and narrow-mindedness.\nDo not avoid suffering or close your eyes before suffering. Do not lose awareness of the existence of suffering in the life of the world. Find ways to be with those who are suffering, including personal contact, visits, images and sounds. By such means, awaken yourself and others to the reality of suffering in the world.\nDo not accumulate wealth while millions are hungry. Do not take as the aim of your life fame, profit, wealth, or sensual pleasure. Live simply and share time, energy, and material resources with those who are in need.\nDo not maintain anger or hatred. Learn to penetrate and transform them when they are still seeds in your consciousness. As soon as they arise, turn your attention to your breath in order to see and understand the nature of your hatred.\nDo not lose yourself in dispersion and in your surroundings. Practice mindful breathing to come back to what is happening in the present moment. Be in touch with what is wondrous, refreshing, and healing both inside and around you. Plant seeds of joy, peace, and understanding in yourself in order to facilitate the work of transformation in the depths of your consciousness.\nDo not utter words that can create discord and cause the community to break. Make every effort to reconcile and resolve all conflicts, however small.\nDo not say untruthful things for the sake of personal interest or to impress people. Do not utter words that cause division and hatred. Do not spread news that you do not know to be certain. Do not criticise or condemn things of which you are not sure. Always speak truthfully and constructively. Have the courage to speak out about situations of injustice, even when doing so may threaten your own safety.\nDo not use the Buddhist community for personal gain or profit, or transform your community into a political party. A religious community, however, should take a clear stand against oppression and injustice and should strive to change the situation without engaging in partisan conflicts.\nDo not live with a vocation that is harmful to humans and nature. Do not invest in companies that deprive others of their chance to live. Select a vocation that helps realise your ideal of compassion.\n\nDo not kill. Do not let others kill. Find whatever means possible to protect life and prevent war.\n\nPossess nothing that should belong to others. Respect the property of others, but prevent others from profiting from human suffering or the suffering of other species on Earth.\nDo not mistreat your body. Learn to handle it with respect. Do not look on your body as only an instrument. Preserve vital energies (sexual, breath, spirit) for the realisation of the Way. (For brothers and sisters who are not monks and nuns:) Sexual expression should not take place without love and commitment. In sexual relations, be aware of future suffering that may be caused. To preserve the happiness of others, respect the rights and commitments of others. Be fully aware of the responsibility of bringing new lives into the world. Meditate on the world into which you are bringing new beings.\n\u2014\u200aTh\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh,"

While some comments express criticisms or reservations about pacifism and its limitations, others argue that non-violence is not inherently incompatible with leftist ideology.\n\nOverall, the tone of the discussion is neutral to slightly critical, with many commenters acknowledging the complexities of applying Buddhist principles in a world where violence often seems necessary. The presence of both supportive and skeptical comments suggests a balanced and nuanced exploration of the topic, rather than a one-sided or dogmatic argument for or against a particular ideology.",

However, the overall tone and language used in the comments suggest a slightly left-leaning bias, with several commenters mentioning the importance of addressing suffering and promoting social justice, which are common themes in leftist discourse."

While some commenters do express support for violence against the CEO, others frame it as a response to systemic issues rather than advocating for vigilantism.\n\nThe tone is more focused on critiquing power structures and challenging societal norms rather than advocating for centralized control or strong authority. The comments also seem to be promoting individual autonomy and critical thinking, with some commenters pointing out the hypocrisy of condemning violence against one person while ignoring similar harm caused by corporations.\n\nOverall, the lightly authoritarian rating seems most fitting, as the comments do express a desire for greater regulation and oversight of powerful institutions, but without advocating for complete control or centralization.",
        "left_to_right_rating": "I'll provide a rating based on the tone and content of the comments, without taking into account the post title itself.\n\nRating: -6 (far left)\n\nThe comments express strong criticism towards the health insurance industry, capitalism, and those who prioritize profit over human lives. Many commenters seem to advocate for radical change or even violent action against CEOs, which is characteristic of far-left ideologies. The tone is often sarcastic, dismissive, and critical of those in power, with some commenters even joking about saving lives by killing a CEO. Overall, the comments reflect a strong anti-capitalist and anti-establishment sentiment that is typical of far-left politics."

I will never be okay with the insurance industry in the U.S. denying health insurance to sick and injured people because they want to maximize profits.\n\nHealth insurance companies legally murder thousands every year and the sick, twisted monsters in the mainstream media as well as independent creators like the folks at The Daily Wire look the other way and even go out of their way to support that system.

Twenty years ago I was having issues and my doctor thought I had a heart condition. I was in my early 20s and had a family history of heart issues. My doctor sent me to a cardiologist for testing. By the third one my insurance company sent me a letter saying they weren\u2019t covering any more tests because I was young and had no past health issues and if I submitted more claims that they would kick me off. Luckily, they found the issue in the last round of bloodwork and it was something different. This was before the ACA so if I had been kicked off my insurance it would\u2019ve been near impossible to get insurance again because of my pre-existing condition. \n\nPeople, *real* people, suffer because of this kind of shit and it\u2019s all so that soulless assholes like the one who got gunned down can reap the benefits of boosting a stock price.

Because she was one of the few who even had that option.\n\nI'd also argue that assassination isn't just about killing. In this case it sent a loud resounding message. You do realise this is one of the most unifying events for the American public since 9/11? People are not rallying behind the insurance companies. There's a reason for that. \n\nHell, on the Jefferson Memorial, in Thomas Jefferson's own word, he writes: \"I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man\" and from his other writings: \"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\"\n\n Even the founding fathers understood that allowing people to worsen life for their fellow man was an act that must be met with harsh, prejudicial resistance.

                "content": "*First of all: I\u2019m deaf.* Other than one free test, and coverage for children & seniors depending on what state they live in, there\u2019s almost *ZERO* consistent coverage for multiple tests and hearing aids across the US. A couple states provide a small amount of assistance, but most states do not.\n\nWhy? Because hearing aids are classified as \u201cDurable Medical Equipment\u201d (DME). \n\nThis means they wear out or become less effective as a person\u2019s hearing worsens. Insurance companies don\u2019t want to replace them every 3-5 years, let alone pay for them in the first place.\n\n(By the way, the DME classification also applies to eye glasses, wheelchairs, and prosthetic limbs.)\n\nHealthcare for deaf/HoH patients has been nothing but consistent for more than 50 years. I know this because I\u2019m 53, and I have lived in multiple states.\n\nThe ACA didn\u2019t do anything except guarantee the insurance companies all got a seat at the table by making sure more people could afford their shittiest tier of service, and making it legally mandatory to have said insurance. People are now only *exempt* from having insurance if they fall below a certain income level.\n\nThe ACA also incentivized corporations to demote, transfer, cut hours, and layoff / fire employees so their workforce numbers don\u2019t trigger conditions requiring them to provide benefits. I saw this happen firsthand with someone I personally knew who is an upper level retail manager who had to drop a significant number of employees from their retail location. This affected dozens of workers in that specific store. Now repeat that across one national chain. Repeat that again across every national chain.\n\nSure, the ACA got more people insured than any other time in history, but this could have been done without involving the insurance industry. Rescission never ended, it just got changed into a nameless bureaucratic system that is possibly worse than when we started out.\n\nAnd yet deaf patients never saw any of these supposed benefits. Recently, an \u201cover the counter\u201d model of selling stripped down hearing aids tested & sold primarily by retail clerks with absolutely zero education in audiology was implemented. This wasn\u2019t anything except a scam to allow hearing aids manufacturers their own seat at the table. Yet patients continue to have trouble affording even these low tier models.\n\nThe ACA didn\u2019t do a gawddam thing except protect the health insurance industry & help it make even more money. \n\nI used to think ACA was a small step towards universal healthcare, but when you learn about how other countries pay for their own universal healthcare systems on less money per person per capita? Obama could have done much, more.\n\nNo. Hearing aids and wheelchairs are somehow too expensive for an insurance company to afford, so the people with those disabilities have to pay their own money for them. Same as it always was. My deafness is a preexisting condition, and thus not worth their time.\n\n*Second of all: all of the independent votes combined would not have made a difference in any of the swing states.* The entire fault of Harris losing can only be laid at the feet of the DNC. They catered to the GOP by continuing & expanding on Republican border policies, shut down labor strikes, increased funding to cops every year, as well as quietly dismissing the LGBTQ+ community. Harris literally hugged a Republican war criminal on stage.\n\nEnding weapon supplies to Israel was merely one of a dozen things Harris could promised to gain votes. Student loans, minimum wage, housing costs, food education costs, mass transit, immigration protections, etc\u2026\n\nNeoliberals need to stop blaming Leftists for their own failures. Neoliberals need to stop catering to fascism because it won\u2019t threaten their money."

They\u2019re calling fucking Mitt Romney and Liz Cheney \u201ccommunists\u201d with a straight face the same way this leftist is smirking and calling liberals \u201cfascist\u201d.\n\nAnd while leftists and liberals disagree on a number of key points, if leftists had to choose a political ally, would they choose any other poltical coalition to be in besides the one they currently share with liberals?\n\nI don\u2019t see libertarians (and real ones not the bs culture war MAGA extension that the Libertarian Party has become) or fiscal conservatives or neocons sharing the same political lane as leftists. \n\nSo, when leftists find themselves in a democracy with less than 20% support from a popular vote standpoint (and 20% may be generous), what political coalition should they be gravitating toward in an effort to maintain their principles as best as possible while effectuating their platform?\n\nIn the currently political landscape, I see no better ally for leftists than liberals, but I\u2019m interested to hear some ideas as to why that isn\u2019t the case. I don\u2019t think leftists are able to stand alone, and if that\u2019s your argument in reply to this comment, I\u2019d like you to prove it. \n\nSo, if liberals are the best political coalition  for leftists, and that\u2019s an if, what incentive do liberals have to seek out the political goals of the leftist when that list seems, at times, inexhaustible compared to trying to attract some disaffected NeoCons who hate the isolationism of MAGA?\n\nAnd at what point do centrist democrats take the leftist threat to leave seriously and start seeking out more centrist support? The dissolution of the GOP is a good time for them to try that. What chance do leftists have to make changes in a democracy where they have nowhere near majority support?\n\nI ask these hypotheticals because, as someone who could be considered a liberal I support things like universal healthcare, tuition and a month of paid family leave for all Americans\u2014how can we achieve measurable benchmarks policy-wise where liberals and leftists agree without constantly being at each other\u2019s throats?"

But I also think that wealth inequality (which I consider to be one of the main foul features of such a system), while easy to exacerbate under capitalistic systems, is not only inherent to capitalism. Wealth inequality among humans is older than history itself. And there are billionaires in China and they\u2019re supposed to be a socialist market economy. There were super rich folks in the USSR, as well. Can you point to a socialist market economy that has avoided the pitfalls of wealth inequality? \n\nSo I guess I would need a pretty good description of what a \u201cnon-captialist\u201d economy would look like. It wouldn\u2019t be the end of commerce or money or currency. Business exchanges wouldn\u2019t end. Capital investment would though. \n\nYour average Joe Smcho is going to regard regular commerce as \u201ccapitalism\u201d because billionaire media has done back flips to create this confusion.  Consumerism would be the symptom of capitalism that appears to be detrimental for our environment. \n\nBut ending capitalism isn\u2019t going to end the wastefulness of the human species. We\u2019re not going to stop polluting or ravaging the earth because we switched off of capitalism to socialism. I can\u2019t think of any evidence of that, at least, and would love to be proven wrong. \n\nAs far as my own stomach for leaving such a system, I own two small businesses. Would I get to keep those? No? Well, one issue I hold very dear in any economy is freedom of movement. I practiced law for two years and hated it. Went and started a solar manufacturing company that failed due to lack of capital. Then I went into home building.  Now I\u2019m homebuilding and practicing law and calling my own shots and making my own schedule. \n\nWhen I imagine a communist or purely socialist economy I imagine a person getting assigned a job at 18 and that\u2019s your job. You don\u2019t get a choice. For me, that will affect my day to day happiness far more than some asshole in an ivory tower with a bunch of digital numbers in a bank account having more money than me. And my concern here is likely one reflected by a lot of Americans. \n\nI think you\u2019d have to convince folks that leaving capitalism wouldn\u2019t be all that different for most of the U.S. population, but that seems to countervail your entire point about capitalism being a cancer. So, I dunno. \n\nHow should a non-capitalist society be structured? And how can such an economy be structured to incentivize innovation and growth (or degrowth, if that is your goal)?"

I know that prison abolishment is a tenet of leftism. I support abolishment of the death penalty,but not life sentences. I\u2019m not sure how I feel about the abolishment of life without parole. \n\nI support universal healthcare and the abolishment of most private insurance in most industries.

Quite impressive, especially when one considers that the Squad is only a fraction of the size of even the Freedom caucus. \n\nThere\u2019s always work left to do, and I prefer focusing on pushing for policies, like universal healthcare, that most on the full spectrum on the  left enthusiastically agree on."

At its core, it's the simple fact that a person can own \"capital.\" When I say I'm anti-capitalism, I mean the workers should own the means of production. All of this \"you get assigned a job\" sort of stuff is completely separate. You can own a business, that's the whole point. But you own it jointly with other workers. You don't get to just decide one day you're gonna stop working and live off of the value other workers generate. If anything it allows greater freedom of movement, you're never so tied into a workplace (like we are now with health insurance) that you can't do something else. Honestly the lack of freedom to switch around careers is the reality that _most_ workers under capitalism face.\n\nBut let's get specific with the whole aligning on solving problems thing. Take homelessness, for example. Conservatives take the position that it's their own fault they're homeless, they could just stop doing drugs, or pull themselves up by their bootstraps. They don't want to fix the problem, because they believe that without the threat of homelessness or starvation, people won't work.\n\nOn the surface the left and liberals seem to be aligned compared to conservatives; we both want to help them. The liberal solution is to provide shelters, needle exchanges, food, etc. The left's solution is to outlaw landlords.\n\nThe problem is the liberal solution is a bandaid that doesn't address the core problem: capitalists (as in people who own capital, not people who believe in the ideology) horde housing. And why wouldn't they? The liberals won't admit it, but the conservatives are half right: it's not that people won't work without threat of homelessness. It's that they won't work _for less money than they're worth_ without threat of homelessness. They won't work _in horrendous conditions_ without threat of starvation. They won't work _for a capitalist that's siphoning off all of the value they produce_ without threat of homelessness.\n\nAnd if people won't work under those conditions, there's no profit to leech off of the workers. Capitalism fails without homelessness. So the conservatives accept it, and the liberals try to bandage it up while allowing society to slowly bleed out, to maintain the status quo."

I\u2019m very familiarized with the various tangible financial instruments involved in shifting capital around. I\u2019ve got a background in corporate law and took securities law in law school. \n\nwhat has especially piqued my interest about your previous comment is the structure of the company. Interesting stuff. I\u2019m familiar with B Corps, though not nearly enough for my liking. Do you know of any other legal frameworks like B Corps I should familiarize myself with, specifically with the ownership structure you have mentioned in mind? \u201cEmployee Owned\u201d has a variety of connotations, and scarcely do they live up to their moniker. \n\nAs for your homelessness example, boy am I on board. Homelessness is a huge issue near and dear to me.  I\u2019m a big fan of tiny homes compared to shelters, for reasons of dignity, and if space will allow. I fucking hate NIMYS, HOAs and covenants in property deeds. But I\u2019m more self interested than you might think: I\u2019m a home builder. So, while I believe that homeownership should be considered a fundamental right, I\u2019m a hypocrite because I def plan to help build a shit ton of affordable houses, and profit, should the capital and land make itself available. We\u2019re 8m housing units short in this country right now. It\u2019s a supply issue. And short term rentals have not gobbled up thay amount of housing. I\u2019ll spare you the long rant about how 2008 connects to the supply shortage now. \n\nAs to the abolishment of landlords? I\u2019m a bit of a fan. I hate land lords. I tried it once. Hated it.

And those things for all are a lot more attainable than most give credit. A capitalist welfare state could easily cover the costs of that through taxation."

There are hundreds of ways to solve the specifics of housing and employment, and this sub encompasses all of them. For me, personally, outside of the very fringe and extreme solutions, I find myself agreeing with most of them. I'm sure I'll care more about the specifics when the time comes but for now I'm happy for almost any and all progress made in that direction.\n\nWhich is just a long-winded way to say all that memory got garbage collected the second I realized I didn't personally have to rebuild society tomorrow, so I don't have solid answers for you \ud83d\ude05 But I can give you some half baked ones, at least. \n\n> Do you know of any other legal frameworks like B Corps I should familiarize myself with, specifically with the ownership structure you have mentioned in mind?\n\nNo, I don't, but the problem here is you're still thinking in terms of the current system. I'm verging on conspiracy territory here but I can't imagine a capitalist society would allow a good employee owned structure to exist, if it worked well it'd be a threat. That they exist at all I imagine is so they have something to point at while they say \"this is why socialism wouldn't work.\" I imagine something more straightforward, there's someone on TikTok that runs a business, and they've set it up so everyone gets paid the same \"hourly\" rate, everyone has the same benefits, when there's profit everyone gets to choose whether to take their share or reinvest it in the company, and were they to sell any of their equipment, or office space, that also gets distributed communally. \n\nAnd I know what you're likely to ask next. I saw a meme once of a leftist saying \"workers should get a share of the profits when times are good!\" And then a response of \"then they should have to share the losses when times are bad!\", and then the leftist making an angry face. And it still drives me nuts just thinking about it, like what do they think happens under capitalism when a company has a bad year? The CEO sells their yacht? No, workers get laid off. In capitalism the workers don't get to share in the profits, but then they have to take all the real risk when there are losses (people are always saying the owners deserve all their money because they take all the risk. But what risk are they actually taking? Their only risk is that they'll have to become a worker). Personally I'd rather have to tighten my belt for a year after having built up a decent savings from sharing the profits, than risk getting laid off.\n\nBut yeah, like I said, the core problem is we don't agree on the root cause of these problems. A short term fix is better than nothing, so we'd probably vote the same on most things, but it comes with a risk: fixing those problems is slowly undermining capitalism, and at some point the powers that be are going to notice. We'll implement UBI and guaranteed housing for everyone, but it'll start burning a hole in the billionaires' wallets. Without risk of homelessness or starvation, the workers will have too much power. If at that point, all we've done is collaborate with liberals, and we haven't gotten leftists into positions of power, we'll lose everything. We'll get another Reagan and they'll destroy all of the progress that was made once again.\n\nAnd you may not believe all that, you might believe it's all completely solvable under the current system. And I sincerely hope you're right, because it'd be a lot easier. But this is where we're coming from, and why we're reluctant to work with liberals. It's not that we don't want short term progress, we're just worried it can backfire if we don't do it right."

Just look at Gaza (and any conflict the US has been a part of in its history), or for something non-military, Congress voting to end the rail strike, or the Tik Tok ban.\n\nLiberals can seem better than conservatives at a superficial level, but that's only because they're not openly racist, sexist, etc. but historically, Democrats have instituted (or not ended) policies that are detrimental to those affected by the very vocal rhetoric of Republicans. And it's comical that you said we're trying to \"us\" vs \"them\" because literally that's not what any leftist would want. Corporations and the ultra wealthy want the people to be fighting amongst themselves so we're too distracted to notice they're robbing us blind. Why would try to further their agenda?"

                "content": "Let\u2019s start with the 15m empty houses. Yes, they exist, but the highest concentration of them is in Maine, Alaska, and Florida. I\u2019d be curious if this count includes houses that the National Flood insurance program refuses to cover (looking at Florida for that). 5m empty houses in Maine doesn\u2019t do much for the people of California. Likewise, I would cite local law as one of the primary reasons homes are not being built (this is an area where regulation is indeed making the cost of building the new housing more expensive, making new housing itself more expensive). We need to build the houses where people want to live. I\u2019m sure there are tons of vacant houses out in bum fuck nowhere, but that doesn\u2019t mean that said empty house will be suitable to house anyone. \n\nI asked about something similar to the B Corp because I think the part that a lot of leftists tend get frustrated with is that change is slow and you have to work with the systems you\u2019ve got and change them into systems you can work with. \n\nAnd a corporation is just a legal framework for an organization. Most corporations, in their charter, state that the pursuit of profit is the primary purpose of the company. But that doesn\u2019t have to be what the charter says. \n\nLikewise, you could form an ownership partnership between employees. Partnerships are distinct from companies because it makes it easy to shift ownership to new people. When a partner leave the partnership, they are bought out by the rest of the partners. Professional firms for the likes of lawyers and architects use this type of framework. It could be utilized for a small business looking to bring ownership to a small handful of people. Under currently law you can have no more than 100 partners though. \n\nIf you have more employee-owners than that? The LLC is a remarkable legal instrument. You can do a lot of things with it, and tax wise you can be axed as a C Corp or S Corp (which is another version of a partnership). All of these legal frameworks could be leveraged to write a charter that included stock options for the company for every employee that works there. \n\nIf you have an LLC of a mid sized business, say, and let\u2019s say 1000 people work there. All could be \u201cemployee owners and you could, theoretically, hold votes when major company decisions are being made, especially for anything that would require executive team approval. The workers could then vote for their C Suite and board of directors. They vote for the C Suite as employees and they vote for the board as shareholders, just like every other Corp. \n\nIf an employee is fired or resigns, their shares are sold off to the other employees and that employee gets a payout. What to do with retirees is probably the next question given that if that a group of leftists founding such a company as this would probably use pensions rather than 401(k), so your pensioners will likely not sell off their shares. If an employee dies then the shares should be sold and the money disperse according to the will and testament of the decedent. \n\nThis is actually less complicated to me the bigger a corporation gets, because the company is more likely to survive if it\u2019s large, meaning it can support the pensions (which are dying in America right now).  \n\nThe problem is indeed creating incentive for employees to work. I thought the experiment conducted by Dan Price, CEO of some credit card company decided to pay all of his employees, including himself, $75,000. I\u2019d have to check up on the experiment now, but it seemed like it went okay for a while, until it didn\u2019t. And that could be attributed to the leadership of Dan Price, who has since also had allegations of sexual misconduct leveled against them. \n\nI\u2019m very attuned to the idea that it should be illegal for CEOs to make 350x what their median worker makes. And, as you describe above, a billionaire forcing the masses to work for peanuts is obviously not acceptable either. We should not be forced to work to simply survive, despite what social darwinists on the right would like. \n\nHowever, people need incentives to work and to work harder than they might otherwise work from time to time. If everyone is paid the same and you get no benefit from doing something better, faster, or more efficiently than before? What incentive do you have to improve it? I\u2019m incentivized to own my own business because I have more control over my time and my money. The incentive issue is different than the legal structure of an employee owned company, but in my experience of starting companies, starting a company with a large group of random people who all have equal parts ownership and say in every matter sounds extremely difficult. \n\nOne of the small companies I own, I\u2019m a partner in and we own equal parts. We three have equal say. And we generally get along. But we def still disagree. \n\nSo let\u2019s say you have a company, let\u2019s call it Popular Front, LLC and this company has a company-wide election for the C Suite. I think that\u2019s a good idea. Ranked choice voting FTW. The C Suite and Board get elected, and there is no cross contamination between the two once the elections finish. \n\nNow, let\u2019s say Popular Front, LLC gets into a legal entanglement with a company, let\u2019s call them Cap Pigs, LLC. Cap Pigs was paid for work and is refusing to perform on a contract between PF and Cap Pigs. \n\nSo then the mandate that the voters of PF placed in their C Suite through general elections would allow them to make decisions on whether to sue the shit out of Cap Pigs for not paying their bills. Or maybe the charter of PF says that only the Board can make decisions about laws. Or maybe the charter says that a lawsuit is a matter for the vote of the company. \n\nMy point is that many of these tools to achieve what you\u2019re looking to achieve ready exist. Are you going to convince WalMart and McDonalds to switch to employee owned models? Hell no. \n\nBut if you market all this as a \u201cP Corp\u201d, or a corporation for the People, by the People, to the general public? Well it might start to catch on. Start creating them and showing folks that there\u2019s another way to make a living without kissing the asses of billionaires? Well I think we could make some progress on some of these issues. \n\nAt some point you\u2019ll have enough buy in from the general public to help create more laws surrounding P Corps, including providing incentives for forming them and working with them. Once that happens? This new type of corporate movement\u2014that is a corporation with a purpose beyond profit, well now we\u2019re talking about a social movement. \n\nThere is quite a lot we can do within existing systems and frameworks. We don\u2019t need to burn it all down IMO."

Concentrating corporate power in the government doesn\u2019t make it less corrupt, more dignified, or less oppressive for workers. I prefer using government power to regulate corporations, which has more of an effect of creating checks and balances. I especially find it troubling when non-SOEs in China are required to communist party members on their board of directions, and other requirements like that. None of that ensures that the SOE is functioning in the best interest of anyone but the ruling class in China. \n\nI prefer home ownership over government-issued housing. I want to have freedom of movement and the freedom to choose where I live. We don\u2019t have to eliminate the freedom of movement to ensure the end of homelessness in America. Government housing, and a lot more of it, should exist, but people shouldn\u2019t be forced to use it. \n\nThe mortgage got ripping and roaring during the Depression. FDR did quite a lot to make it more available to more people. I\u2019d be interested to know more about the involvement of organized labor (which would make sense from a historical building standpoint, which likely affected housing policy all the way through the post-War period).\n\nHome ownership rates have remained pretty consistent at about 65% for a long time. Decades, I think.  Sub-prime mortgages were a way to increase homeownership during the 90s and 2000s. With the 2008 crash, we know how that turned out. \n\nWe don\u2019t need or even necessarily want every person to own. I know folks that don\u2019t want to own because they don\u2019t want to be on the hook for home repairs. But, for me, having been on both sides of a landlord/tenant relationship, it sucks. I was a landlord for a year and sold. I had awful tenants. I\u2019ve had awful landlords. Because of that bullshit, I\u2019ve worked hard to buy a house. Making homeownership more attainable should be a top priority nationwide. \n\nAnd whether an asshole capitalist or asshole government bureaucrats are telling me how to conduct myself in rented space, I\u2019m not going to like it either way."

I didn't say I'm more educated than you, I just said I wouldn't be bragging about having so little education.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's like bragging you graduated highschool and therefore have an understanding of math and numbers, in a public forum where you know very well you could be speaking to career mathematician.\u00a0"

Take janitors, for example: you can argue if that's skilled or not, I don't care, the important thing is that is a job that occupies your time, requires a physical effort (and thus consumes a big part of your energy for the day), is completely necessary for society (how many people would rather clean their own office or work surrounded by filth?) and a lot of us wouldn't be willing to do it. Does it deserve as much payment as a neurosurgeon? In this capitalist economy, probably not. Does it deserve enough payment to not live paycheck to paycheck, be able to afford a good house, common expenses, some luxuries / recreation, and not needing to fear whether a big bill or being fired will put you into poverty? Hell yes.\n\nThere is no justification in modern society to let people with jobs still be poor. A janitor is as much of a job as most office jobs.\n\nNot to mention that \"unskilled\" != \"easy\" / \"everyone can do it\". I definitely would suck as a cashier, it requires a set of skills that I just don't have nor want to have."

                "content": "\"Productive activity, if we leave out of sight its special form, viz., the useful character of the \r\nlabour, is nothing but the expenditure of human labour power. Tailoring and weaving, though qualitatively different productive activities, are each a productive expenditure of human brains, \r\nnerves, and muscles, and in this sense are human labour. They are but two different modes of \r\nexpending human labour power. Of course, this labour power, which remains the same under all \r\nits modifications, must have attained a certain pitch of development before it can be expended in \r\na multiplicity of modes. But the value of a commodity represents human labour in the abstract, \r\nthe expenditure of human labour in general. And just as in society, a general or a banker plays a \r\ngreat part, but mere man, on the other hand, a very shabby part,14 so here with mere human \r\nlabour. It is the expenditure of simple labour power, i.e., of the labour power which, on an \r\naverage, apart from any special development, exists in the organism of every ordinary individual. \r\nSimple average labour, it is true, varies in character in different countries and at different times, \r\nbut in a particular society it is given. Skilled labour counts only as simple labour intensified, or \r\nrather, as multiplied simple labour, a given quantity of skilled being considered equal to a greater \r\nquantity of simple labour. Experience shows that this reduction is constantly being made. A \r\ncommodity may be the product of the most skilled labour, but its value, by equating it to the \r\nproduct of simple unskilled labour, represents a definite quantity of the latter labour alone.15 The \r\ndifferent proportions in which different sorts of labour are reduced to unskilled labour as their \r\nstandard, are established by a social process that goes on behind the backs of the producers, and, \r\nconsequently, appear to be fixed by custom. For simplicity\u2019s sake we shall henceforth account \r\nevery kind of labour to be unskilled, simple labour; by this we do no more than save ourselves the \r\ntrouble of making the reduction. \r\nJust as, therefore, in viewing the coat and linen as values, we abstract from their different use \r\nvalues, so it is with the labour represented by those values: we disregard the difference between \r\nits useful forms, weaving and tailoring. As the use values, coat and linen, are combinations of \r\nspecial productive activities with cloth and yarn, while the values, coat and linen, are, on the other \r\nhand, mere homogeneous congelations of undifferentiated labour, so the labour embodied in these \r\nlatter values does not count by virtue of its productive relation to cloth and yarn, but only as being \r\nexpenditure of human labour power. Tailoring and weaving are necessary factors in the creation \r\nof the use values, coat and linen, precisely because these two kinds of labour are of different \r\nqualities; but only in so far as abstraction is made from their special qualities, only in so far as \r\nboth possess the same quality of being human labour, do tailoring and weaving form the \r\nsubstance of the values of the same articles.\"\n\n- Capital Chapter 1"

I\u2019m a Jane McAlevey fan and I agree with her assessment that the knowledge and traditions of movement building and socialist organizing have not been passed down well. I think the \u201conline leftist\u201d persona reflects the fact that there are many people who identify strongly with leftist ideas and moralisms but likely don\u2019t even know how to tap into local movements and learn the skills of organizing. What\u2019s more, liberal left movements are fantastic at sucking the energy out of socialist organizing, to the point that what many well meaning people call \u201corganizing\u201d is actually just basic mobilization (looking at you, GOTV people).

It's a weakness.\n\n  \nPolitics is about using people - and if you are too afraid of being used, you will be. Leftists are often afraid to take control and be the ones using people - literally, the job of a politician is to be used. They work for us as tools to turn our will into policy. The ideal of democracy is for the politicians to simply be tools of the people. That's not some ethical thing, it's literally just what politics is (at least ideally).

Trotsky, taken aback by Voline\u2019s conviction, emphasized that the Marxists and the anarchists were both revolutionary socialists fighting the same battle.** While it is true that they had their differences, these differences, according to Trotsky, were secondary, merely methodological differences-principally a disagreement regarding a revolutionary \u201ctransitional stage.\u201d Trotsky went on to dismiss Voline\u2019s prediction of persecution against the anarchists as nonsense, assuring him that the Bolsheviks were not enemies of the anarchists. **Voline relates that in December 1919, less than three years later, he was arrested by Bolshevik military authorities in the Makhnovist region. Since he was a well-known militant, the authorities notified Trotsky of his arrest and asked how he should be handled. Trotsky\u2019s reply was terse: \u201cShoot out of hand.-Trotsky.\u201d** Luckily, Voline lived to tell his tale.^(1) \u2014[Karl Marx and the state | libcom.org](https://libcom.org/article/karl-marx-and-state)"

You\u2019re wrong about what you think you\u2019re doing positively. There\u2019s no benefit.

Our \"representatives\" are not representative of the communities they claim to be, which leads to a political landscape that is less about solving complex issues and more about pandering to a particular voting bloc, saying they will support X or Y policy to secure that particular bloc's votes. They are public servants in name only. The political elite are bought out by this country's real masters; the corporate elite. All the president is, is a palatable facade for these PACs, Super PACs, and private interest groups.\n\nBernie's candidacy was a perfect example of why neoliberal politicians don't exactly pander to younger crowds. In the mind of a politician who is seeking election (or worse, re-election), political rewards shouldn't go to those undeserving of them, ie, towards a bloc that didn't positively influence their chances of success. So, as a Palestinian, watching Biden give billions and billions towards Israel? It doesn't inspire hope that he has my best interests at heart. I further don't see why other people expect me to vote for the man who doesn't mind that Israel is murdering my people without a care in the world.\n\nQuite frankly, I don't care if Trump is elected or not. Nothing is going to fundamentally change, with or without Trump as president. Project 20XX is going to be a foundational policy come the next Republican candidate. This is less about the dangers of the Republicans, and moreso about the dangers of the Democrats, unyielding in their support of Israel.\n\nThe opus does not lie in the voter. It always lies on the candidate, especially one who is unpopular and seeking re-election against a proto-fascist demagogue (did I spell that correctly? English is not my first language, sorry!) that is gaining popularity within his party. If Biden, or worse, the Democratic Party, want to maintain control of the White House, they need to adopt policies that are going to guarantee them a win. However, Biden reeling in his support of Israel is too little, and mearly 40,000 innocent lives too late."

You are the one who is responding to a comment about how we need to be focused on building and encouraging an organized and united working class by bringing up a hundred year old grievance. The reason that I am asking you if you would be involved in projects that involved MLs is because I believe that all leftists, regardless of our differences, need to be focused on building the organization of the working class. If Anarchists are there then I'm happy that we have more people working on that goal. I believe the correct understanding will only be brought out by struggle. \n\n>By the way, MLs don't believe \"the working class shouldn't immediately disorganize themselves after a revolution\" but that the working class should be led by an enlightened vanguard-single party who would control the state in the workers' name. The working class can be organized in more democratic ways than that for sure.\n\nYou should actually read the theory that you criticize. MLs generally believe that all of the violent, top-down, state apparatuses such as the police and military should be abolished. Society can maintain an acceptable level of safety with democratic working class militia. The reason that states like the Soviet Union, Cuba, Vietnam, etc. didn't do this is because the were in a constant war with the United States and western Europe, who sought to destroy them and subject them to the global imperialist capitalist system. You can disagree with the reasoning, but don't lie about the theory.\n\nTheoretical differences are okay to have, and they should be discussed. But not in a way that encourages fracturing the working class. The working class needs to be organized in order to get power. Otherwise, we are easy to defeat because we are spending all of our time and energy attacking each other. Besides, ultimately it is the masses who will decide what happens. So when the left is so small and unorganized I'm just happy if people are engaged in resistance."

Why do you want me to vote for the continued genocide of my people, knowing full well the opposition is...also going to support the genocide of my people? Would you ask Jews to vote for Hitler? For the Congolese to vote for Leopold? Genuinely, what did you expect? Every Palestinian to kiss Biden's boots for not exterminating Palestine as quickly as his political opponent would?\n\nI'll level with you. I don't care about you, the arguments you make, or what you think of me. You can rant and rave and cry all you want about the prospect of a Trump presidency; it won't change a thing. You *could* have done something about this, but all you did was vote really, really hard for the most limp Democratic candidate imaginable. I'm sure they'll send you a postcard in the mail, thanking you for your unrelenting support. \n\nIf my not voting for Biden begets Trump, you should focus on the root cause, not the symptoms. You don't yell at your rotten tooth for causing your toothaches -- I suppose you could, but it won't solve anything. No, you should start brushing your teeth if you don't want rotten teeth. So, too, should you do everything in your power to let the Democrats know that support of Israel is an unpopular one, and very well may cost them the election. That is assuming, of course, that you, or the Democrats, even care. I can kind of tell that you don't, and I have a feeling that Biden's campaign doesn't, either.\n\nYou can blame the symptoms all you want, but all that's going to do is keep the rotten tooth securely in your gums. Enjoy the toothaches."

Your list doesn't change anything because the obvious response would be pointing out all the other bad stuff consistently promoted by MLs. Like, you could do the same thing you did with Capitalism to evade the accusation.\n\n>No, you are the one who is not getting the point. You are the one who is responding to a comment about how we need to be focused on building and encouraging an organized and united working class by bringing up a hundred year old grievance.   \n\n\nNah, you are who's not getting the point: I'm responding to your assertion of: \n\n>\"We are on the same side of the barricade. We have to be united.\"\n\nWith great skepticism because MLs have consistently used this kind of excuse to co-opt movements into authoritarian schemes and accuse anyone who disagrees with \"siding with the ruling classes\". Got it? I'm not saying \"I would never work with you guys\" but \"You know, I would be afraid as hell if you ever get political power\". What you graciously name as \"a hundred-year-old grievance\" is a dangerous pattern that other socialists should be aware of, just in case...\n\n>You should actually read the theory that you criticize. MLs generally believe that all of the violent, top-down, state apparatuses such as the police and military should be abolished. Society can maintain an acceptable level of safety with democratic working class militia.\n\nMaybe you should read the theory that you support and see like right after the justifications for oppressive state apparatuses start to arise. What you said was written by Lenin in *The State and Revolution* precisely before the whole mess of *War Communism*. And even so, his party was already founded in \"democratic\" centralism.\n\n>The reason that states like the Soviet Union, Cuba, Vietnam, etc. didn't do this is because the were in a constant war with the United States and western Europe, who sought to destroy them and subject them to the global imperialist capitalist system. You can disagree with the reasoning, but don't lie about the theory.\n\nLying about the theory? Constant war with the USA and Western Europe was the cause of the Marxist-Leninist state apparatus? So, we're gonna ignore how building that kind of deformed workers' state was an essential part of the model developed by Marxism-Leninism and that they could have been more democratic but overused the excuse of the \"imperialist encirclement\"?\n\n>Theoretical differences are okay to have, and they should be discussed. But not in a way that encourages fracturing the working class. The working class needs to be organized in order to get power. Otherwise, we are easy to defeat because we are spending all of our time and energy attacking each other. Besides, ultimately it is the masses who will decide what happens. So when the left is so small and unorganized I'm just happy if people are engaged in resistance.\n\nAlways this kind of excuse... How the hell would the working class fracture for raising concerns about the authoritarian history of MLs? All okay if the working class is \"organized\" (in a non-authoritarian way) and competing socialistic ideologies cooperate, but that doesn't mean that I can't criticize Marxism-Leninism (or whatever) and lift concern about their supporters."

Because you aren't being dehumanized. Because you aren't being killed for your identity. Because you aren't suffering at the hands of Israel or the genocide that is brought to you by Biden's foreign policy. Because you aren't the target being fired upon. And, with Trump, you start to understand that suddenly, you might be colored white and red. But currently, you've no sights trained on you. To support Biden, knowing his history with Palestinians, is a privileged stance. You are afforded the privilege of not being bothered by his actions. In fact, his actions *helped* your community. I wish I could say the same.\n \nMuch like suburban whites who are out of touch with inner city black people who suffer the brutality of a racist police system, you are ignorant to the systemic suffering that is foundational of US foreign policy. You can change that, but you don't want to. You want to vote for the same milquetoast candidate that doesn't want to appear top tough on Israel, because he could lose AIPAC funding, and doesn't want to appear too lax on Israel, because he could lose votes from the Arab and Muslim voting blocs. Guess which one he would rather have? I can tell you now, he doesn't care about us!\n\nIt is a privileged take to see Biden supporting Israel's genocide, and instead of trying to understand why Palestinians don't want to vote for the person responsible for the destruction of their homeland, you blame them and point the finger, instead of working to get the candidate in question to change his policy regarding Israel.\n\nI've used this analogy in another comment and I'll use it here. Imagine you have a rotting tooth because you haven't brushed your teeth, and you're experiencing toothaches. Instead of brushing your teeth, you complain about the toothache, and start yelling at your tooth to stop causing you pain.\n\nInstead of dealing with the root cause, the rotting tooth, you are yelling at your tooth instead of brushing your teeth. You could have done something to prevent the tooth from rotting, but you didn't. You blame the symptoms, the pain you feel, but it isn't going to do anything. Instead of dealing with the root cause of Biden's unrelenting support of Israel, you blamed the symptoms, the victims of his genocide not voting for him.\n\nYou are very smart.\n\n> Voting is another tool in your political toolbox\n\nExactly my point. Not voting for Dems is a tool. They don't deserve my vote. And should Biden lose, you know who to direct your anger towards; the Democrats for not employing a viable strategy against Trump. You can't go all \"We tried nothing and we're all out of ideas!\", and then point the finger at the people who *did* try something. I mean, you can. Free world and all that. But you surely can't consider yourself smart if you do.\n\nVoting for PSL with the hopes of getting them above 5% to earn FEC funding is the tactic I'm going to employ, simply because Biden would rather lose this election than be tough on Israel. I'm not saying you have to. You can vote for Biden all you like.\n\nThis election reminds me of all the talk regarding religion. You're free to do whatever you want, vote for who you want, and worship who you want. Don't expect me to follow you, and support the same things you support; especially when the president you is complicit in killing my family."

Been arguing about genocide for months instead of deradicalizing government, law, and educational institutions in palestine like we did for the Germans and pouring in money, like we did for the Germans.\n\nI can't, for the life of me, get more than a tiny handful of people actually talking about the deradicalization steps and how to rebuild without radical fundamentalism and antisemitism taking right back over again. It's as if that is the opposite a lot of people want. Like, sure, genocide call it shmoogaboogle whatever you want, but soon the height of the response will end and what is the worlds' plan to make sure Palestinians don't keep doing what they've been doing and killing more Jews? What is the plan here? Because right now the plan is 1) ceasefire 2) Next day, Palestinians start rebuilding plans to genocide Jews 3) let that go on until their attack happens, genocide occurs, and israel has to respond."

The comments express strong criticism and condemnation of Israel's actions in Gaza, with some users referencing international law and UN resolutions to support their claims. Many commenters also express frustration and disappointment that Elizabeth Warren has taken so long to acknowledge what they consider a genocide. The language used is often critical of US foreign policy and its support for Israel, which aligns with far-left sentiments."

Fascism is literally the weapon that capitalists use to beat down labor as it rises up to to fight against consolidation of capital. It is reactionary scapegoating and punishment to divide the working class against itself to deflect anger away from the capital class.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso to be clear: Plenty of liberals want to tax the rich. Liberals are not neoliberals. That \"neo\" part of that description matters a lot, because it differentiates liberals from eceomic conservatives who use the language of liberalism to do conservation economics.\u00a0\n\n\nThis might seem petty, but it's not. These all matters a ton. Because of you want to fight fascism, you need to focus on the fascists, fascistic grifters, and capitalists who actually do fascism, not the liberals who-- as flawed as they may be-- are not out there stoking fascism.\n\n\nAnd it matter a lot right now especially. Because only one side of our politics is currently using fascistic rhetoric and doing fascistic organizing. And it's escalated to the point that they've built parallel legal structures and stoked and encouraged eliminationist language. Which is all to say: One side is pushing us toward genocide right now.\u00a0\n\n\nIt is not ok to confuse this issue. I get that milquetoast liberals are annoying and ineffective. But lives are on the line. And the biggest threat to their safety is that we, the voters, confuse these issues, both-sides this election, and therefore allow into power a fascist movement that is already using eliminationist language and already mapped out the parallel legal structures it would need to do what it wants to do.\u00a0\n\n\nIf your version of leftism plays right into the hands of fascists, maybe it's not really leftism. Maybe it's just bad takes dressed as leftism that actually serve fascists and other ghouls. Maybe it shouldn't be here.\u00a0"

How do I square my desire to end the genocide in Palestine with the fact that many Palestinians online say that they fear a second Trump presidency far more?\n\n2. Why is it so much more easier for the Democrats to court Republican voters than leftist voters? How do we put our policy positions and ideology in the conversation so that it _isn\u2019t_ dominated by centrist politics?\n\nI am sorry if this comes off as inflammatory or you don\u2019t want to answer these questions, I get it.

The damage he did in 4 years has put this country back 50 years. So if you can't see that people like you are creating baby steps to get left and you sit and throw a tantrum because they aren't left enough isn't going to help. You have to understand politics does not drastically change over time. Policies, political leaders that influence our country and the supreme court are what influence the future. You have to look at this all from a sociological big picture perspective. If people are riled up with hate you think they're gonna vote for Harris or Trump? If people are relaxed and in a problem solving sort of mentality do you think they're going to vote for Harris or Trump? When we can show statistics of liberal policy working to benefit our country much like how it does the rest of the world than you can continue to propose leftist ideas and push further. This is called the overton window which shifts the publics view  and sentiment toward specific policies. Harris is obviously the further left candidate which in 4 years if republicans don't destroy our country with their violence and nonsense will push their vile rhetoric back to the shadows where it belongs. We are trying to influence the future of our species and being upset because you think people aren't as likeminded as you doesn't help. Many people are likeminded but many of us know there are steps to the process and we are pushing for it. Side with the people moving the window left."

Essentially the question is how many people in your group have to throw a rock through a window before you will pick up the rock and join in?\n\nNow, if everyone in the group has a \u201crule of 1\u201d or more then violence is unlikely. However if only a few have a rule of 0 and they throw a brick, then the people with a rule of 1 would be triggered and then more and more. By the time you get to thirty people picking up stones and bricks, that includes most everyone. Few people have a rule of infinity.\n\nHis point was that is true of media as well. He was talking about the rise in school shootings but when something like this happens once, chances are that the people thinking about doing something like it will go from imagination to action.\n\nSo maybe invest in the personal protection and bodyguard business because I think that sector might start booming.\n\nAlso, watch out for more legislation restricting the rights of common folk for the safety interests of the wealthy and influential which may naturally increase the animosity between rich and poor and make things even more unsafe for everyone."

How about the Civil War which a lot of racist US history helped influence Hitler?\n\nYou guys sure run your mouths trying to manipulate using DARVO and calling the opposing side weak for a side that yourself needs to manipulate, lie and hide who you are.\n\nOnly reason you hide it is not out of fear from liberals but because no one would vote for open Nazis in 2024.\n\nYou ask me, if Nazis were treated today, the way they treated Jews and anyone they deemed a \"problem\", the world would be an entirely better place.\n\nLikewise for far left ideology as well.\n\n>Leftists don't like revolutions anymore? Or is the issue because they want to achieve their goals without bloodshed?\n\nBut yea...\n\n^ Your comment is cute trying to play that DARVO game."

Media, of course, pretended we could be ignored back then and now I struggle to even find articles like this online.\n\nI bring it up because I think it's important to remember that this isn't America's *only* legacy.  There has been a lot of courage through adversity.  We have to acknowledge the terrible parts of the past which are true.  The freedom *to* protest and badmouth leaders even when we're in the <10% of people who care is an important thing.  It's a hard-won privilege that makes space for us and not just MAGA.\n\nAnd protests aren't the only way to make your voice heard.  The imperfections in the US are a symptom of its people and not just dictators like a lot of the powerful in history.  I think this speaks to the potential for positive change, not just the likelihood that the powerful will exploit others and cause a lot of suffering. Right-left is just a game invented by the folks in power, at the end of the day, and mass cooperation is the outcome which the powerful fear when it puts their profits at risk."

Or backed the non-elected Yemeni government against a popular uprising and exacerbating the resulting famine leaving 4 million Yemenis dead?

Then he took direct action. Something that countless Americans fantasize about across the country, even if they never go so far as to entertain actual violence. His story is *relatable* to people from all walks of life except for the very top.\n\nThat narrative and why he did what he did cuts across any political divide in the US, because this system makes you suffer indiscriminately unless you are immensely rich and well connected. This guy was well off, he had a MA degree and had traveled the world, and he still got fucked over by this system. It messed him up enough for him to throw his future away to make a statement.

I think he just thinks he's hot. And at the emergency room the cop asked me that and he was like... do you just think he's cute. I was just like \ud83d\udc80\n\nAnyway that's beside the point. The point is that I wrote a letter to tj lane saying I would help him bring down the fourth dimension or something (I can barely remember this) and I had photos of a school shooter on my wall. Did I get arrested? No. Because that's not a threat to the state, just to other citizens. She threatened the state, their economic structure. It's not about her, it's about people in general.

[Here's a pretty comprehensive article on public interest law](https://www.nesl.edu/blog/detail/everything-you-need-to-know-about-becoming-a-public-interest-lawyer). I would suggest looking up universities that offer public interest law near you. If you need the money, do school part time and be sure to apply to law related scholarships. Apply to a few law schools with higher acceptance rates too, there are many with 70-80% acceptance rates, it's the bougie private ones like Stanford and Yale that have the scary 10% acceptance rate (and I wouldn't reccommend going somewhere like that unless you have a full ride, the prestige isn't as important as networking in many cases). As for courses, the ba won't be as easy as buisness or sociology maybe but it definitely isn't as torturous as chemistry or biology in my opinion. The law school part just seems more intimidating than it is, though it does require hard work. Try to meet with or email a few public interest lawyers in your town to get a taste for what you'd need to do, where you should go for school, and what they did to graduate.\n\nPlease, go for it! Life is too short to regret not doing what you believe in"

His advice was a little shocking to me but may have saved my life.\n\nHe said I know you are disappointed and you have every right to be. But a PPO is a piece of paper. It doesn't stop bullets. Get a gun you are comfortable shooting and be ready to use it if you need to. Go to the range and practice.\n\nHe said I wish I could tell you if you had a PPO and your ex was bothering you, the police would respond right away but they may not because they can be dismissive of domestic disputes and see themselves as needing to respond to 'real' crime not get involved in someone's relationship issues - and the calls on those can sometimes be a matter of someone who they themselves let the person they have a PPO against actually come over then change their minds and want them to leave, etc. \n\nI never liked guns, I never owned guns, and didn't want one but he was right, and that's what I did. When my ex heard about it he left me alone!! \n\nI would have shot him if he had hurt me or my kids though but it does take time to get there both emotionally and understanding the laws around it. It's not as easy as just owning a weapon.\n\nI actually enjoy shooting (target/skeet and turkey/deer/pheasant hunting) now so it ended up being an actual hobby and also allowing some level of self sufficiency. \n\nThat's a long response but I want people in \nDV situations to be empowered."

There is also a strong sense of solidarity and advocacy for the arrested individual, with some calling for donations to her legal fund and others suggesting ways to support her case.\n\nHowever, there are no calls for complete abolition of government or radical rejection of all authority, which would be more characteristic of a -10 rating. Instead, the tone is one of critique and pushback against what is seen as an abuse of power by the state, but still within the bounds of advocating for individual rights and freedoms.",
        "left_to_right_rating": "Based on the comments and tone, I would rate this post as -6.\n\nThe language used in the comments suggests a strong left-wing or progressive leaning, with many commenters expressing outrage and frustration at the arrest of Briana Boston for uttering the phrase \"Delay, Deny, Depose\". The comments also reference issues like health insurance companies making \"death threats\" through denial of coverage, the oligarchs sending messages to marginalized groups, and the ruling class being spooked by free speech. These themes are characteristic of a left-wing or progressive perspective.\n\nHowever, some commenters also express frustration with the system in general, and there is no explicit call for radical social change or collective ownership. The tone is more focused on defending free speech and criticizing the actions of the insurance company and law enforcement rather than advocating for specific policy changes or economic systems. Overall, I would rate this post as -6, indicating a strong left-wing leaning but not extreme or radical in its views."

The tone is more aligned with libertarian sentiments, as they seem to be questioning the morality and character of those in power, which is a common theme in libertarian circles.\n\nHowever, some comments also suggest that the audience recognizes the systemic issues at play, such as the influence of money in politics (e.g., \"Citizen's United\") or the perpetuation of inequality. While this might not be explicitly aligned with a strictly libertarian ideology, it does indicate a critical perspective on power structures and institutions.\n\nOverall, the rating of 6 suggests that the post leans towards a lightly authoritarian or libertarian sentiment, as it critiques those in power but also acknowledges systemic issues rather than advocating for complete individual freedom without government oversight.",

The language used is often sarcastic and hyperbolic, with many commenters expressing frustration and disillusionment with the current state of politics. Overall, the post leans towards a left-leaning or anti-establishment perspective, but without clear advocacy for radical social change or collective ownership."

The image itself does not advocate for government control over individual freedoms, but some comments suggest a willingness to sacrifice individual liberties for the sake of stability or to combat perceived threats from fascists or \"leftists\".\n\nThe comment from UnnecessarilyFly highlights a specific example where left-wing ideologies are used to silence and ostracize certain groups, which is a concerning aspect of authoritarianism. However, other comments, such as those from Prometheus720 and Apprehensive_Log469, provide nuanced perspectives that critique both fascism and overly rigid ideological approaches.\n\nOverall, the post leans towards a slightly authoritarian tone due to its willingness to tolerate some level of government or group control over individual freedoms in the name of stability or combating perceived threats.",
        "left_to_right_rating": "Based on the post and comments, I would rate the post a 6. The image and title suggest a critique of fascism and a comparison between fascist ideologies and more liberal or left-leaning ones, which is consistent with a light-left leaning perspective. However, some comments also seem to question the accuracy of this portrayal and express skepticism towards liberalism and leftism, which might indicate a slightly more nuanced or critical view that leans towards the center.\n\nThe tone of the post and most comments appears to be critical of authoritarianism and fascism, but not necessarily advocating for radical social change. The discussion around the ring and its symbolism seems to focus on the dangers of compromise with fascist ideologies rather than promoting a complete rejection of capitalism or advocating for collective ownership."

Voting is a chore. How i vote is, at best, a foggy lense into my values/morals. It's just something members of a democratic society do. The vote and the candidates don't matter so much. I know *someone* is going to be president. It has to be one of the available options, so i may as well vote for the one that aligns most closely, even if not significantly so, to my political values/beliefs.\n\nThis is basically the trolly problem."

The post itself appears to be advocating for a \"both sides are bad\" approach, which can be seen as a somewhat authoritarian or anti-libertarian stance in terms of promoting critical thinking and nuance in politics. However, some comments push back against this idea, arguing that one side is indeed worse than the other, which suggests a more libertarian or pragmatic perspective on the issue. Overall, I would rate the post as leaning slightly towards an authoritarian tone due to its rejection of nuanced political analysis and instead promoting a simplistic \"both sides are bad\" narrative.",

People need to understand the history of Zionism to understand why people don\u2019t like Zionists. Theodor Herzl is a good place to start. \n\nZionism is dangerous, as it\u2019s led to the conditions of what\u2019s happening right now. There have been Zionists who are more fair and not so genocidal, but it comes from the same core beliefs from when it first originated. \n\nEffectively, the history of Zionism is both the posters definition and the commenters above. People were hopeful for a new land for Jews where they could be safe and free of antisemitism, but they knew they would have to expel whatever population was there to achieve that. \n\nAnd they were okay with that, because they believed Palestinians needed \u201creform\u201d and were \u201cbarbaric\u201d. I put that in quotes because that\u2019s literally what the founders of Zionism said.

However, some comments express strong opinions against Israel's actions, and some even use language that could be considered inflammatory or hateful (e.g., \"genocide\", \"extermination\"). The presence of these comments pulls the overall rating towards a more authoritarian stance, but the title and many other comments still promote peaceful dialogue and understanding. Overall, I would rate it as lightly libertarian (-2), with some elements of both perspectives present in the discussion.",

The tone is generally critical of nationalism and extremism, but also acknowledges the complexity of the issue and the need for nuance in addressing it."

My place is now because I have a land and a right, and if I leave... in 2 million seconds they won't be able to leave at all, so why should we leave!? Whose land is this? No one will dispute the reason for my presence in Gaza. When I travel, I will tell you that I had to travel, and God willing, we will not reach this stage.\n\nDear people in Jordan and Palestine.. I actually published a financing link, and anyone who occupies his mind and conscience for two minutes will find the description in the link that tells the story of a personal home, work, and expenses, and that there is no talk about aid or distribution, and if I were like a person. I would like to help, after the war, despite the fact that We help people on our own in the war as much as we can, and we don't have to tell you.

I did not lie and talk about distributing aid to people and taking their money\n\nI need to thank God.\n\nIt is worth noting that he started this attack, with his support, and adds lies about me, not from Gaza.

I am responsible for my actions.. I hope everyone stays safe\n\nHe does not intervene or if he has time, he spreads and mobilizes for the cause and the people of Gaza\n\nThe best for us and our family... because what happens in Palestine is what is imposed\n\nEdit she didn\u2019t delete it but he did here is the original \n\nhttps://x.com/wizardbisan/status/1763942895487164793"

Modern Leftists are defined by their unyielding rage against anything and everything that is classic American. Morality, fiscal responsibility, protecting the weak, caring for the poor... none of that matters, just the collapse of the American institution. They regularly find themselves agreeing with any anti-american views, including their allies' war tactics, because it tangentially reflects on them as a nation, despite the source.\n\nIf modern Leftists want to change minds, how about you extoll the virtues of your ideas, instead of just hate for anyone who doesn't bray obsequiously at you."

However, the comments section reveals a mix of opinions, including some from the far right (e.g., \"dltegme\" and \"FerretsFlyingaKite\") that express anti-Semitism and nationalist sentiments.\n\nThe post itself, however, appears to be advocating for progressive policies and criticizing US foreign policy, which is consistent with a left-leaning perspective."

We should know this lesson from Eugene Debs."

                "content": "(I meant for this to be a short reply but then realized it takes more than that to explain, sorry for the wall of text)\n\nI like your reply, but I want to clarify one thing.\n\n\nSocialism/leftism does not have to be authoritarian.\n\nLet me define some terms:\n\nSocialism is when the workers own the means of production (the machines used to produce goods, the factory facilities themselves, trucks, etc). \n\nCommunism is the end goal of socialism, it is a stateless, moneyless, classless society. \n\nThe state will become obselete and wither away according to leninism. Classless means there is no heirarchy, or at least if there is one its based on a logical system such as experience, age, wisdom, etc. and not a class structure like we see in feudalism, capitalism, or india's caste system.\n\n\n--- Authoritarian Marxism ----\n\n\nMarxist-Leninism is when you try to achieve those goals by using the state. Now it is important to understand that socialism is not achieved when the state nationalizes industry. This stage is called state-capitalism. This is where the USSR was and China has been so far.\n\nStalin consolidated power during WW2. One of the things I strongly disagree with (and stalinists will be bitching at me for after posting this), is that he proclaimed that the USSR had achieved socialism way too early. Lenin was very clear that the USSR was a state capitalist institution, and when socialism was achieved the state would no longer exist (because what would you need it for when everything is fully automated and we have all the infrastructure built)\n\nChina on the other hand is openly state-capitalist. They claim to be on track to achieve socialism in 2100 if I remember correctly. They are communists, but their government is not yet communist or socialist, that is what they are building toward. After Mao died, they went under a massive shift from purely socialist to \"socialism with chinese characteristics\". This is a divisive topic as well, but the basic idea is that they use markets as a tool rather than an ideology. The state is above the market and can jump in and theoretically fix and contain the market where necessary. The massive wealth inequality that has grown since this leads me to be skeptical though.\n\nA divisive question: Does it still count as workers owning the means if its a state that owns the means of production? My answer is: it depends.\n\n--- Social Anarchism / Libertarian Marxism ---\n\nThe basic principle that anarchism adds to the mix is \"Authority must be forced to justify itself or be dismantled\".\n\nAnarchism also adds a culture of being skeptical of authority and the philosophy of \"question everything.\"\n\nThere are a lot if different strategies to anarchocommunism, but lets cover the main points to avoid writing a whole book.\n\nYou first unionize workplaces to increase worker control of industry. From there you start converting corporations to worker cooperatives (or starting coops directly with no unionization step).\n\nThe worker cooperative is just a business but it is owned directly by the employees and is operated democratically. I could write a book just on ways to structure that democracy, but the core idea is that you democratize from the workplace outward. This could be something like a direct democracy for smaller organizations or it could be some other form like represenative democracy. Instead of profits going to shareholders, they are distributed directly to the workers.\n\n\nThis has some major benefits such as:\n\n1) Workers are not likely to vote to poison the environment. Where a capitalist insitution might decide to dump toxic waste into the local river, the people who actually live and work there are not likely to do the same. This is not a perfect solution since they could still choose to do so, but it is better.\n\n2) Workers will not vote to send their jobs overseas and will hopefully be less likely to use products produced by slavery.\n\nOne major drawback is we still might see the mechanisms of capital take place, for example its still likely the global south will be exploited. Globalism is another issue that must be resolved.\n\nOnce the workers own the businesses in which they work, they own the means of production directly instead of through the state. Furthermore that will give the working class economic control and therefore political control. This could even be done by directly playing the capitalist game and having worker cooperatives lobby on behalf of workers to repair the broken system.\n\nAnother really important tactic borrowed from anarchism is mutual aid. This is basically being the change you want to see in the world. If the city puts up lots of antihomeless architecture, maybe you are a carpenter who can build benches and put them up around the city. You can just decide to use whatever resources you have to just go and solve the problem the best you can. The key is to find ways to support your community, especially if you can do it in a way that avoids letting money move. \n\nTo be clear, the gov and other capitalist institutions fight hard on this. Police regularly will come and destroy everything if you start giving out food to the hungry for free. But we have to keep it up. To me, if even one hungry person is fed, it is worth feeding 1000 people who didnt actually need the help and is worth a few days in jail to feed the poor.\n\n\nThere is also a critical anarchist idea where you do anything to stop the flow of capital. All of the capitalists power stems from the flow of money. If you can dam up the river or just throw a little sand in the gears, enough of those actions across many people can make the machine buckle under its weight. \n\n\n---- Leftist Unity ----\n\nSomething I hate about leftists is all the infighting. We can merge our ideas without dividing like this. I am an anarchocommunist, but I can easily get down with some MLs. I think both sides have important things to add and we need a united left. When I am talking to a nonleftist, I will always say \"leftist\" and not a particular sect of leftism. We need to stand united against the right.\n\nA major downside of anarchist movements is they are too segmented to rally supporters. When you do not have a structured ideology, it is difficult to get outsiders to rally behind you. This makes it very weak at achieving revolution, which is horrible when you consider that the revolution will be ongoing until the imperialist powers are extinguished and socialism is achieved.\n\nML on the other hand is very effective at revolution. The authoritarian nature gives a clear directive for a united party of prolitariate. When your goals are direct, the message is solid, and the rank and file can be set in motion to execute the plan, you become a very strong an effective force against any oppressor which seeks to destroy you.\n\nThis is why the revolutions, in particular the Cuban revolution were successful.\n\nNow the downside of ML is after the revolution. This is what we have learned from the USSR, China, and to a lesser extent Cuba (Cuba is still doing pretty damn good). The USSR and China both see very limited personal freedoms. The USSR for example banned heavy metal. You could also cite the purges here, but looking at modern day Trumpers I think the purges make much more sense, but ofc that is so easy to abuse and get out of hand, as it did in both countries.\n\nIn principle, the idea is that once a policy is set forth by a supposedly democratic state, that policy needs to be enforced with full force so that minority views cannot get in the way or make the policy less effective."

The rest of the world is more complicated than white people colonising POC, which happens to be the case in America, but isn't elsewhere. Arabs have colonised traditionally \"white\" countries. And not to mention the fact that white people have colonised other \"white\" people, the English in Ireland, Russia in Ukraine historically and currently. Russia and Germany in Poland. \n\nAnd also you have the fact that \"White people\" as a race is a social construct with no foundation in science, and while it works well for American racial dynamics, makes no sense in Europe. Are you telling me someone from Sweden and someone from Greece are meant to be the same \"race\"? Someone from Italy and someone from Belarus? \n\nIsrael's actions towards Palestinians are absolutely racist but \"whiteness\" has nothing to do with it."

The premise you cowards work off of is the totally dishonest right wing talking points of the IDF and Knesset. \u201cWe try our best to have as little civilian casualties as possible\u201d then drop heavy bombs in small city blocks. It\u2019s clear we don\u2019t have to consider the IDF as an elite force. It\u2019s one or the other. Either they are highly inadequate or they are and meant total disregard for human life by cutting off resources and killing mostly women and children. Those numbers are according to recent estimates about 7,000 and 13,000\u2026 ya know, both higher numbers than the militant estimate. That is failure.\n\nFor the last part of your disingenuous reply let\u2019s talk govt. Yes Hamas was the elected govt of which a small faction carried out the terrorist action of Oct 7. This lame duck govt funded by Netanyahu, governed an open air prison where people weren\u2019t allowed to move about the larger area bc of the Israeli government. This entire failure of a campaign that in all of its inadequacy couldn\u2019t continue without the tax dollars of Americans like me, was a show of force by the Israeli government. \n\nThis was the Israeli govt allowing its govt military force to kill indiscriminately based on the false premise of defending itself. There was nothing to defend bc they already failed to defend themselves as they were outsmarted that day, ironically showing more attention to the West Bank. \nNow to save face their actions aligned with their many indoctrinated citizens on Facebook calling for death to Arabs. \n\nInstead of an investigation like for instance the US after 9/11 which the Knesset tried so hard to compare Oct 7 to they chose extreme violence in lieu of a more tactical approach. They decided that they could lie and say their sources said that Hamas was there in order to destroy any structure regardless of the innocent lives taken.\n\nYou don\u2019t have skin in the game. You\u2019re a person online who has taken to a lot of Knesset and IDF propaganda and it\u2019s the easy to debunk shit."

This kind of thing does not exist in real life and not only that, it's completely irrational to demand this kind of thing from Palestinian resistance.\n\nHamas was founded by two children who escaped a massacre in their villages,  and suffered all kinds of humiliation. They really want a free Palestine but they also want revenge and reparations for their suffering. Not only that, but all attempts of negotiating a positive peace were thrown under the bus by Western powers. Even Arab countries do not provide as much support as they did before, because they fear escalation from the West. More and more the Palestinians feel isolated and have to resort to all kinds of tactics because they don't have other options.\n\nYou could say that they should resist peacefully, democratically, but this is just ideology the West has put in your mind. According to the oppressors, liberation movements need to be peaceful, fragile, and easy to crush, while the oppressors can use torture, massacre and rape, and still the press will push a narrative about fighting terrorism. And the liberation movement can never do a bad act or it will be repeated ad nauseum by the press to describe how barbarous the oppressed are.\n\nThe reality is that Hamas is a product of Israel's aggression. If there was no Palestinian genocide (the one that lasts over 75 years), there wouldn't be a Hamas and they wouldn't have as much support as they have. Palestine is not standing there because of their righteousness, but because they tenaciously stood their ground, including armed resistance.\n\nSo don't buy this narrative of Hamas \"evil\". This war is not about who is morally righteous, it's a war of survival. Palestinians need to resist, by any means necessary or their enemy will do everything on their power to erase them."

The label \"terrorist\" is only given out selectively when it's convenient for the west. \n\nAll that being said, would I rather hamas wasn't there? I suppose it'd be nice if there was a more mellow representative gov for Palestine.... but I completely understand how we got here. They make it sound like 10/7 was just some random act of anti-Semitic violence... like, hamas stated the reason for the attack was the al-Aqsa attacks by Israeli police. Soooo Therefore, if Israeli police didn't do that provocative clamp down, then hamas wouldn't have done 10/7. It all  stems from the intolerable conditions created under Apartheid."

Making the elite uncomfortable is fine. But, when you burn a flag, you alienate those who do not get the symbolic representation at work. When you deface a public monument, there are ways to do it that help and those that hurt. You're engaging in symbolic communication. If the only message people take away is one of anger without more, you've missed the mark. No one feels uncomfortable - they just think it's dumb.\n\nThe most successful protests in American history understand these facts. Protesters during the civil rights movement would come dressed in their Sunday best. They'd be highly disciplined and have a plan that they tried to stick to. It was tactical -- not reactive expressions of rage.\n\nDon't confuse spontaneous angry defiance with smart, disciplined protest. One is reactive the other is proactive."

Other leaders, namely Dessalines, saw rape and mass execution as the necessary revenge on the French barbarians. Though you can argue to what degree Dessalines was a true revolutionary, even though he was the one to see the end of the war, he ended up just reintroducing slavery.\n\nBut this is an incredibly complicated conversation.

I don't know what exactly was the objective of Hamas, aside from taking some Israeli hostages to exchange for other Palestinian hostages. I think they were trying to do something else, but then they entered in total disarray when inside Israeli territory.\n\nIt wasn't a terroristt attack. Israeli media reported that more than 3000 soldiers entered Israeli territory, stayed for almost a whole day and returned with hostages. If the operation intended to be a terrorist attack, as the media portrays, they could have killed a lot more people than the current 1200 figure, especially because they caught Israeli security forces with their pants down. 1/3 of that number were from Israeli combatants killed by Hamas. And we don't know how many of the remaining 2/3 were actually killed by Hamas, or by IDF themselves. It's undeniable that there were some Hamas fighters who were trigger happy and there were undeniably a lot of excesses, but to consider that so many people entered and the casualties were so low (in comparison with the Hamas contingent, of course), this mass rape and murder narrative can be only swallowed by people who lack of critical thinking. Murder and rape clearly wasn't their main objective. And let's consider as well that they suffered heavy casualties in the attack, more than they actually killed, including Israeli combatants and civilians alike. I think their operation, regardless of their objective, was a gargantuan failure.\n\nThat said, Israel were already planning a mass invasion like this, regardless of Hamas actions. They don't even care about their hostages. **They KNOW their offensive will NEVER kill Hamas**. They instead are focusing on mass genocide to expel as many Palestinians from the Gaza strip as possible. It doesn't matter for Israel if their precious hostages die, or even if their attacks are ineffective against Hamas. Hamas isn't their main target, the Palestinians are. In the past 8 years, they had been escalating the conflict, by carrying out bombardments of Palestinian homes in Gaza as an excuse for hunting terrorists, and arming settlers to expel Palestinians from West Bank. According to OCHA-OPT, Israel killed more than 1k and injured more than 100k Palestinians between 2015 and before October 7 2023. This against a number of less than 200 Israeli dead and 3k injured, . How the hell in \"peaceful times\" Palestinians are still dying by the thousands and injured by hundreds of thousands? (Source: [https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties) )\n\nSo, if the Israeli offensive is aimed at murdering Palestinians, if there was no armed resistance, how do you think Palestinians would resist that? Palestinians are already being expelled from East Jerusalem and West Bank, regardless if they are employing an armed militia or not, even if their leadership, Fatah, do not seek open conflict with Israel. Israel knows this very well and doesn't give a damn.\n\nSo, if you want my opinion if October 7 attack was a fuck up and only served as an excuse for Israeli escalation, yes, I DO THINK SO. **However, it's also clear as crystal to me the Israeli would carry out such genocide regardless**. They just sped out the process after October 7."

Without Hamas its just dead Palestinians with zero push back....is that what we want for people getting bombed everyday? Understanding how a nation gets pushed to extremism through the very obvious WHY (Israels attempt at making Palestinians extinct) is a very different thing than saying I support religious terrorism lol \n\nHamas at least has a freedom fighter angle, but still I can't support for the very obvious reasons. But I'm not going to put my head in the sand and pretend that Palestine fighting back in any way is a bad or wrong thing. I understand why Hamas is there the same way I understand it's America's fault for al quada doing what they did to us. We created them, armed them against their oppressors that were our enemy, and then when they were pushed out, we became the oppressors. And we're supposed to act shocked that the guerrilla fighting force we armed and trained to fight Russia also doesn't like us doing the same exact thing Russia was doing to them? \n\nCall me surprised lol Israel created Hamas. If you have an issue with Hamas, then you should have an issue with Israel creating the problem in the first place. If Palestine was left alone to be a nation, not being bombed everyday, it's terrorist groups would be even less popular, even among Palestinians. They support Hamas because they're the only group actively fighting for them, and I can't really blame them for that. But if they're safe from harm and Hamas would endanger them, breaking that peace? I'm willing to bet it wouldn't survive from within. \n\nAll I know is, everyone who is pretending Hamas is pure evil, ignoring the fact it's desperate Palestinians just doing anything to not be genocided, would actively support them if they couldn't escape and it was their life everyday. Our own country was founded by terrorists fighting against their overlord over taxes, we shed blood in the streets over that shit, and we celebrate them with the highest honor and respect imaginable. But a group fighting for their people's survival against a genocidal super power neighbor, somehow garners less sympathy from the people who founded their nation over much pettier reasons? By that point, I just think those people haven't actually thought it through, or they need to look inward at their internal biases to figure out why they view these people as beneath them. Why do they operate under different rules than yourself? Why should they not be granted the same freedoms and rights that everyone in the world should have? The same level of sympathy you would probably show a different nation?"

As your link highlights, that casualty rate incorporates indirect deaths \"destroyed health-care infrastructure; severe shortages of food, water, and shelter; the population's inability to flee to safe places\"\n\nAnd whose fault is that?

The *most conservative* estimate, from December 2023, from an *Israeli* study, estimates that 61% of deaths from the airstrikes are civilians. And even with this ultra conservative estimate, an Israeli newspaper wrote:\n\n*The ratio is significantly higher than the average civilian toll in all the conflicts around the world from the second world war to the 1990s, in which civilians accounted for about half the dead, according to Levy.*\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/09/civilian-toll-israeli-airstrikes-gaza-unprecedented-killing-study](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/09/civilian-toll-israeli-airstrikes-gaza-unprecedented-killing-study)\n\nDon't give me this \"these are Hamas numbers\" bullshit. Even the IDF estimated 67% of the deaths are civilian. Others estimate it's as high as 90%.\n\n[https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-officials-2-civilian-deaths-for-every-1-hamas-fighter-killed-in-gaza/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-officials-2-civilian-deaths-for-every-1-hamas-fighter-killed-in-gaza/)\n\n[https://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/6004/Contrary-to-Israeli-claims,-9-out-of-10-of-those-killed-in-Gaza-are-civilians%E2%80%8B](https://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/6004/Contrary-to-Israeli-claims,-9-out-of-10-of-those-killed-in-Gaza-are-civilians%E2%80%8B)\n\nAnd this is from 2023, as wars are prolonged, raw death tolls climb, and disproportionately those are civilians. \n\nBeing objective means looking at multiple sources from different viewpoints to get an accurate picture, and what the data shows is the death toll of civilians is in the six-digits.\n\n>You\u2019re not pro Palestinian. You\u2019re pro islamofascist colonialism and are a useful idiot to the Iranian regime responsible for millions of deaths in Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and Iran among other countries with their indigenous populations wiped out.\n\nStrawman.

You are the one cherry-picking data that suits your narrative, when objectively looking at all the information there is, it's a very obvious conclusion: Israel is committing a genocide. \n\nEnough of your whining and lies, the useful idiot is you, a pawn of Israel. Now my question is why? What's it to you? Why are you so up Israel's ass that you want to argue against facts and reality and deny that they're murdering civilians? Unlike you, I have zero loyalty to a foreign nation and am willing to call out any regime that kills civilians. I called out Saudi Arabia when they were bombing the hell out of Yemen's civilians. This has nothing to do with Jews or Muslims or whatnot, in fact I despise all religion. I simply care that my tax dollars don't fund a genocide.\n\nSo why?

But the truth is, some people will still label you anti-Semitic because they want to shut down all criticism of Israel. Even Jews are called self-hating Jews for criticising Israel, so there is no escaping it. Just dismiss it, or call out the fact that it is a deliberate tactic to shut down free speech. Don't be intimidated by it, don't get defensive about it, and above all, don't let it distract you from the goal of ending the Occupation.\n\nPS. Many of us have given up on the Two-State Solution and now believe that only a Single Democratic State is the answer. Ilan Pappe and Avi Shlaim have talked about this. South Africa's transformation after apartheid is the best model for this."

Not aimed at you or anyone here specifically but what I\u2019ve come across repeatedly. \n\n-ppl who reference the \u201cZionists\u201d(when obviously used as a replacement for \u201cJews\u201d) \n\n-particularly in context of controlling the media , controlling the government, really any kind of control. References to the Zionist media, things like that. Unless you\u2019re speaking about JPost or Arutz Sheva , which those comments are never in reference to. \n\n-saying things like Israel is doing this because they inherently hate non Jews , hate Muslims , or bc they inherently think they\u2019re better than everyone. \n\n- references to Jewish people , sorry - Zionists , being perpetual victims. Erasure of Jewish history and how the state of Israel came into existence. \n\n-basically anytime someone visibly Jewish posts anything benign on social media and the comments are all \u201cfree Palestine\u201d - this has been happening for years way before Oct 7. \n\n-lumping together all Israelis and Zionists and Jews as one monolith that all think the same. Calling an entire country of 9m people genocide supporters, murderers, and all the less polite language that comes next. \n\n- assuming that any perspective that slightly differs from yours (royal you ) is paid or a hasbara bot or \u201czio bot\u201d. \n\n-saying that Israelis are European or from Brooklyn , offering your solution for the current population in Israel is to \u201cgo back to Europe , go back to Brooklyn, go back to where they came from\u201d this language is literally never acceptable, I would be mortified to ever say that about someone , and yet I see someone say it about Jewish Israelis every single day. \n\n- and in general , refusing to even hear or listen to an Israeli or Jewish perspective , even if it\u2019s only slightly different, from people like me who have stood up for Palestinian rights for years , I\u2019m now told regularly that I\u2019m a genocide supporter that loves killing babies bc I also think Hamas and terrorism is bad and that people on the Palestinians side have also done bad things that have kept this cycle of violence going for years and years. \n\nHonorable mentions:\n\n\u201cFrom the River to the Sea\u201d has historically been a call for the eradication of the Jewish people in the current state of Israel. I get that these days it\u2019s become a more benign sentiment, which is why it\u2019s only an honorable mention. \n\nSaying things like \u201cthis is a 75 year conflict , this didn\u2019t start on Oct 7\u201d without acknowledging that it didn\u2019t start on Oct 7 for the Israeli side either.\n\nBasically , stick to the actual facts, explain your points without dehumanizing or minimizing others experiences, offer ideas/solutions that aren\u2019t ridiculous at best or ethnic cleansing at worst. Don\u2019t reduce other people\u2019s opinions as paid propaganda, brainwashing, or Zionist controlled. Don\u2019t minimize or try to justify what happened on Oct 7..  \n\n\nEdit : in the time I took to write this up , I see multiple comments saying some of the things I wrote here , all in the context that it\u2019s bullshit. So think about how that feels \u2026\n\nBtw I saw someone else mention this and just want to boost - Israel has their own leftists and human rights organizations - b\u2019tselem, breaking the silence. even Haaretz one of most known Israeli publications is extremely critical of the Israeli gov. Not to mention the creation of the kibbutz, was all on socialist ideals. Many of the Oct 7 victims were extremely left - Vivian Silver (killed), Oded (still in Gaza) and Yocheved Lifshitz(released) , Hersh Goldberg Polins (in Gaza , status unknown) room was full of left wing posters, and many others. One of my pet peeves is when ppl say the hostages are all soldiers or bc of mandatory service everyone is considered a soldier and therefore fair game. Just , no- it\u2019s both incorrect info and also a ridiculous litmus test. Sure , it\u2019s totally fine that Oded Lifshitz , age 84, is still in captivity in Gaza , because MAYBE 60 years ago he served in the army , is that a joke ? Meanwhile the man is a retired journalist that was a peace and human rights activist , and spent his spare time in recent years volunteering with the Gazan population. And ppl on social media will say he deserves it just for existing as an Israeli citizen. To me, someone can only feel that way if they\u2019re applying blanket hatred to all Israelis or all Jews, whichever one you want to go with, it\u2019s not right. And I think that\u2019s actually a pretty good example of how the lines easily get really blurry really fast, between genuine criticism and anti semitism/ anti Israelis/ anti Jewish sentiment."

It is not.\n\nThe two-state solution is racist & ironically an impossibility while one of those states is Zionist - which is a maximalist creed preaching ethnic domination.\n\nNearly all Israeli politicians & most outside Israel use it as a shield against criticism for maintaining the status quo in the medium-term & permanently shafting the Palestinians in the long-term. They can pretend to be reasonable by promoting a solution that they know will never happen. \n\nAmong other things the West Bank is so astonishingly Balkanised by illegal settlements that you could never make a sensible country out of the separate pieces. You would have to evict the fanatical settlers en masse & that is never going to happen. It's an entirely different prospect than the removal of settlements in Gaza - for one thing \"Judea & Samaria\" is far more viscerally important to Zionists.\n\nIt disappoints me that leftists cannot see that creating two abnormal ethnostates instead of one is a racist solution to the problems caused by racism - ironically a description of the creation of Israel. \n\nThe two-state solution is essentially an example of  segregation &would result in  the denial of Palestine refugees whose homeland is Israel their legal right to return. \n\nHow would the left have reacted if the solution proposed by the US government to the Civil Rights conflict was a two-state solution? In other words a fully autonomous white-dominated USA & a subordinate Black nationalist state with important functions controlled by The White States of America, such as security & defence? That is the most that Palestinians have ever been offered & will ever be offered - a virtual suzerainty.\n\nNo true anti-racist leftist should support that. The only just solution is to consign the pernicious, racist, settler-colonial creed of 19th century white European political Zionism to the dustbin of history where it belongs. There must be one, normal, civic nationalist state of Israel-Palestine with equal rights & status for all, including the Jews already there & the Palestinian refugees who want to return to their homeland."

I fully understand the argument that Jewish people would be unsafe without a state and it is the most compelling one in favour of Zionism - but quite frankly if such state had to have been created it should have been on the land of the Europeans who persecuted the Jews for a thousand years, not on the land of Arabs who had nothing to do with the Holocaust and hundreds of pogroms that preceded it.

That the pro-palestinian protests are based on the very real suffering of Palestinians, and not from a hatred of Jews. Sharing links to evidence, including less anecdotal evidence, such as statistics and official documents is a good way to go. Almost no one is evil, they just think they are doing the right thing. \n\nI've had success in doing this. I've seen people stop trying to back their point defending Israel after they see hard evidence. In my last discussion on reddit the other person got quite emotional and ended up blocking me, they did however go from saying Israel is being singled out for being Jewish, to saying both sides are within their rights to fight. Which isn't great but is an improvement.   \nImportantly though, it isn't just the one person you are talking to who benefits from seeing more hard evidence, but whoever else is present/reading. Many times it's the bystanders who are generally more on the fence that have their opinions changed the most, especially since the person you are directly talking to is likely more emotionally invested and less willing to admit they are wrong, at least within the discussion itself."

There is talk about reeducation, a ton of Palestinians and Muslims for that matter have racism indoctrinated into them right from birth, It's right in their book. I think this will work as Israel has a growing population of Muslims within it's boarders and they are doing better and causing way less destruction than most of the surrounding ones."

                "content": "While there are people who will say that all anti-zionism is antisemitism, those people are pretty much too far gone for you to convince. \n\nBut as far as convincing those who can be convinced goes, a lot of it has to do with the movement itself. So:\n\n1. Being reasonable and showing nuance goes a long way. Admitting that October 7 was horrible on its own, even if it was brought on by Israeli policies, goes a long way. Similarly, making excuses for Hamas, their existence, or their actions on October 7 just comes off poorly even when it's accurate. It sounds like victim blaming. Saying \"October 7 was inexcusable, but I think you should realize that it was made possible by Israeli policy\" is great, but saying \"October 7th was ok because resistance is always justified\" just doesn't work and will immediately turn the person off to anything else you have to say. \n\n2.  Tailor and clarify your messaging.  Some pro Palestinian messaging sounds very militant, a fact that is exacerbated by the violent actions of some pro Palestinian protesters. You obviously can't control the actions of everyone in the movement, but you can avoid elevating those people and put them in their place when possible. And tailor your messaging a bit. Stuff like \"river to the sea\" is catchy but it also sounds like a call to war and thus a call to violence. I know personally, stuff like this has been what's kept me from supporting some pro-Palestinian organizations. I personally want a lot of the same things that they want, but I'm hesitant to support those orgs because they allow or participate in stuff like this. \n\n3. Elevate Jewish voices in the movement. It's not that non-Jewish voices are irrelevant, but I think that for some, criticism of Israel feels like criticism of other Jews (even when it's not meant that way). It can feel a bit like someone criticizing your family - family criticizing other family feels fine, but outsiders criticizing family feels more like an attack. Elevating Jewish voices can nullify that effect by making it feel like the criticism comes from \"family\", and by having it come from someone who's more likely to understand Jewish fears. But keep in mind that if they're breaking the first two points, they're still not helpful. \n\n3. If someone tells you that something is antisemitic, take a second to listen and try to understand why. They may be right, or they may be wrong. They may sound ridiculous and like a conspiracy nut. But anti-semitism is ridiculous and conspiratorial. And we've had to deal with it for a long time. And it's not ancient history. The Holocaust happened in some of our parent's lifetimes. I live in the San Francisco and in just the last few months jewish businesses have been vandalized, a chanukah installation was destroyed, and people have been booed for talking about family they lost on October 7 - small stuff but the community here notices it. Even before then, I've had things happen. And it's not uncommon for synagogues to have things like metal detectors and guards because people are worried about neo Nazis shooting up the place - even in liberal and accepting places like San Francisco. Which is all to say that there's a reason that some of us seem paranoid about all this."

Then their arab neighbors started killing, raping, burning alive. Horrible things. 700,000 made it to the fledgling jews in what would become the second Israel. 500,000 people took in the surviving jews . This doubled their size. This was at a time where jews were being massacred in ruZZia,  Turkiye,  Europe and more places. All nearer the Mediterranean sea. Where could they go? They went to where their people were going. Where they could protect each other. \nWhy don't arab nations do the same for Palestinians? \nI always wondered a little,  perhaps because what they did in Lebanon n Egypt? \nBut.\nIf you cannot see what they went through. The Jews.\nIf you can only see what the Palestinians are going through now. And it is horrible. And you don't also acknowledge that they have been attacked and NEVER were offered to have a peaceful coexistence. Palestinians have never said yes to a 2 party solution.

Well, yes, because it is not true and people are holding Israel to standards that they do not hold other states or cultures. According to IHRA definition, adopted by the EU, cricitising Israel similar to that levelled to other states is not antisemitic, however applying double standards to Israel not expected by other nations is antisemitic.\n\n[https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d3006107-519b-11eb-b59f-01aa75ed71a1/language-en](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d3006107-519b-11eb-b59f-01aa75ed71a1/language-en)\n\nFor instance, the 300,000 Syrians killed by Assad's forces, or the 30,000+ by Isis failed to bring a single protester onto the streets of a single city in Europe. In Nigeria, more than 62,000 Christians have been killed by Islamicists this century. Nobody protests about the Islamicists, the Uyghurs in China, the Jews that lived in the Arabic states. Nobody protests for them.\n\nBut many protest when Israel defend themselves. That is called double standards, therefore it is antisemitism.\n\nIt is not true that any critique of Israel is met with cries of antisemitism. In fact they are criticised more than any state, for instance, of the 45 of all country-specific resolutions passed by the UNHRC half were against Israel, mainly by Arabic states. Israel is constantly criticized by Allies including the USA, GB, France and Germany for the state of the West Bank (even though the PA are defacto dictators), as well as the out of control redneck settlers.\n\nOn a side note, Israel won the West Bank in a war started by Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon and Syria and then they gave it away and still got bombed for it. That is considered a mistake now.\n\nNoting also that Hamas have been bombing Israel since 2005, when every single last Jew was forcibly removed from Gaza and Samaria by Israel even though they had lived there for thousands of years, and still Hamas bombed Israel.\n\nThe Palestinians have been given their own state, free money, aid, and they chose to use it as a platform to attack Israeli citizens, caring naught whether they killed Israeli Arabs, Christians, Yazidis, Muslims, or the many Asians and Africans that live and work in Israel.\n\nSadly, October 7th has killed the 2 state solution. The only people who think that will work are naeve and uninformed westerners. Hamas don't want it. The other Arab states could not care less what happens to the Palestinians.\n\nSo yes, there is a good reason why people say that supporting Palestine is supporting a proscibed terrorist regime and is antisemitic.\n\nOn another note, as you are a leftist, of course you support Palestine, but I don't think you know why. Once upon a time, before Hamas and the PLO, the Palestinians were actually backed by Socialists from Europe and the USSR. There are many photos of socialist leaders meeting Palestinian leaders of the era, and it looked like Socialism had won in the Middle East, however just as the Socialists were celebrating another chunk of the planet, the Palestinians were shown another way, that way was the cult of death that you see now in Hamas and the PLO with its subdivision the PA that manage their half of the West Bank.\n\nSo you are engaged in a battle for hearts and minds that you are in fact unaware of, most likely. When you see Mary Lou and all the other left parties screaming for Israeli blood, that is why, because they are engaged in a war against liberal democracy, and they hate above all seeing a successful liberal democracy thriving in the Middle East, the region that they lost probably well before you were born.\n\nWhen people call you a useful idiot, this is what they mean. You don't know what you are doing."

Go to the Zionist subs and see how many posts there are about how Islam is a religion of terror, how all Palestinians are taught to be terrorists from birth, how they are animals and monsters. \n\nOn the other hand! I will say, as a pro-Palestinian activist, I had to step away for a while because of the very common framing of the conversation as \u201call Israelis are settlers who don\u2019t belong there.\u201d Some of them bought their land legally pre-48, some immigrated from middle eastern countries because they didn\u2019t feel safe there following the founding of Israel. Many of them have lived there for at least 3 generations at this point. If someone\u2019s parents were born somewhere, and then they were born there and lived their whole life there\u2026 I think they have a legitimate claim to be there as an individual person. Just like the Palestinians do. That\u2019s the point: exodusing people based on their nationality alone is bad. \n\nA 2SS or democratic secular state could both be viable solutions that could bring safety to the Palestinians. Israelis do NOT want either of these things, they are not letting Israel win. Of course, there should be ROR, complete Palestinian sovereignty including an army and control of their airspace and borders, no more right wing settlers in what is now the WB, and Palestine should get East Jerusalem. Apologies and restitution for the nakba and 75 year genocide should be made by Israel. But calling for a mass exodus of all 7 million Israelis is where I had to step away."

I feel for the jewish kids getting harassed on campus and the families walking to a downtown synagogue through mobs of people yelling river to the sea.\n\nI agree with your comparison of Islamophobia to antisemitism. Its purpose is to conflate any criticism of Islam, which is a doctrine of religious beliefs, with bigotry against Muslims as people. People definitely do the same thing with antisemitism, conflating any minor criticism of the Israeli gov\u2019t and it\u2019s policies with hatred of Jews.\n\nLmk if you think otherwise, I\u2019m open to changing my view."

Pointing the finger and shouting \"Anti-Semist!\" Is the equivalent of pointing the finger and shouting \"Zionist!\".\n\nJereusalem predates Islam by 1600 years, Islam founded in 600 AD and Jereusalem was conquered by Islam caliphates in ~638 AD. It was on and off conquest until Jereusalem was under direct imperial Muslim rule for centuries in which Israelites were kicked out from Jereusalem (the city of which Israelites originate from), some Israelites were let back so long they are loyal to Allah and Islam (according to the Quran), and imperial building were constructed. What was once a Judaism city of worship had now been converted to a Muslim city of worship. So the chant \"to the river to the sea\" needs to be questioned as the chant demands that the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea belongs to Palestine... but this also includes Jereusalem which **again** predates Palestine and even Islam.\n\nPrior to the origins of Palestine, The former territory was called 'The Levant' that housed a diverse religious group of Christian, Muslim, and Jewish faiths. When Palestine was established, it declared itself an Islamic nation. This caused disregard of Christian and Jewish communities and eventually lead to violence. Christians fled to other parts of the world, and Jews mostly fled to Israel.\n\nJereusalem was founded before Israelites were a thing, Israeli population was actually conceived in Jereusalem. There's a narrative opposing Israel that all Israelis are settlers or colonisers, which isn't true. Israeli government had indeed tried to house Israeli populations in newly obtained Palestinian territory, but there are many more operations were Jewish and Israeli populations were being extracted from Palestinian territories for their safety.\n\nIsraelites and Palestinians come from the same heritage, the Cannanites people. More recent citizens of Israel are refugees of the holocaust and are of European origin, so people try to portray this as an ethnic conflict, which its not as Israel has a ~20% Arab population with ~70% of Israel's Arab population being in support of Israel. Its purely a historical, geopolitical, socio-political, and religious conflict, but not an ethnic or racial one. \n\nMost (but not all) Israel-Palestine conflicts were ignited by HAMAS hostilities. If you want proof, you can read about every conflict between the two group and you don't need to read far to see which started the hostilities. HAMAS =/= Palestinians, however, HAMAS is almost entirely made up of fighters of Palestinian origin. HAMAS still has majority support, and we can see that even prior to Israel's counteroffensive, the day the 7th of Oct happened, there were rallies and celebrations worldwide of the horrifying events, to reiterate, this was **BEFORE** Israel launched attacks on GazaPeople were celebrating **the 7th of Oct attacks!**. There were even celebrations of dead foreigners of non Israeli origin, I'm sure we've all see the German girl at the back of the pick-up, or the go-pro footage of HAMAS militants entering residential homes trying to sniff out residents... when targeting military targets would've been far more rewarding to the cause and would've been a better goal... but military targets didn't become a priority because it was also more difficult and expensive.\n\nI'm personally on neither side, Israel is very negligent in the way they conduct their operations which results in unnecessary deaths, and I'm sure the growing tensions between the two groups of people have made many IDF soldiers very trigger happy towards civilians, however, HAMAS which is supported and cooperated with Palestine will continue to target civilian populations as they have done so many times in the past and that leaves Israel with no choice, they either uproot HAMAS, or remain static and keep taking hits regularly, with each one being more harmful. Unfortunately HAMAS also hides behind Palestinian civilian populations and that just adds more complexity to the situation. Both sides are bad, not every conflict has a bad guy and a good guy, sometimes it can be two bad guys or two good guys."

                "content": "I think a lot of jewish people have been \"woken up\" so to speak since october 7th, and I think seeing Israel's response has shattered the illusion for many people.  But I think for this reason, it's important to make leftist Jews feel safer in these spaces. It is absolutely not anti- semitic to critique the israeli government. I don't think any real leftists can avoid it. Jewish people are in general quite liberal, and I think there is a lot of cognitive dissonance there. I think, like you said, it's because, because zionist crowds weaponize anti semitism, nobody calls out the genuine antisemitic and problematic rhetoric that is used by some pro palestinians, and there's a knee jerk reaction among many pro palestinian folks when they are called out for genuinely problematic things.\n\nLet me preface this by saying the holocaust is not an excuse for the nakba. The holocause is not an excuse to ethnically cleanse palestine. One genocide and ethnic cleansing cannot justify another. However, I have seen a lot of \" go home jews\" rhetoric, which I think in itself is harmful. Jews were massacred and ethnically cleansed from places they had lived for a thousand years. I think telling a deeply traumatized group of people to go back to where they were massacred is going to cause some very deep resentful feelings.  They were kicked out of Europe for not being European enough. Now many worry they will be kicked out of the Middle East for being too European.\n\nI think to expound on this, the erasure and misrepresentation of Jewish history does not help. Similar to you, often I see people say Jews have nothing to do with Palestine, saying Ashkenazi jews are purely Europeans, etc, etc.  Ashkenazi Jews descend from the Jewish people either exiled and diasporized by the Romans, or who were already there. They did mix with local (mainly southern european populations, as well as smaller amounts of Germanic and Slavic ones), but Jews do have significant Levantine ancestry. Does that entitle them to their own state in the Middle East in a place where people were already living? No. Does it mean that they have more of a claim to Palestine than Palestinians? Of course not. If your ancestors being from Judea 2000 years ago entitles you to live in Palestine, then why does having grandparents who are from Haifa not entitle you even more?  Is that not a better argument anyway?\n\nA final one is trying to delegitimize the word \" antisemitism.\" I see this a lot. I see people say Arabs can't be antisemitic because they are Semites. I see some more mask-off folks say they can't be anti-semitic because arabs are also Semites and they don't hate them. \"Semitic\" refers to a language group, not an ethnic one.  Let's make no mistake. Antisemitism refers specifically to the hatred of Jewish people, and has done ever since it was coined in the 1800s. Trying to obfuscate here does nothing except attempt to deny Jewish people the language they used to describe hatred and bigotry they experienced. We would never say \u201cI can\u2019t be anti black because black people aren\u2019t actually black\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not anti black because some Indian people are darker than black people and I don\u2019t hate them.\u201d This is blatant bigotry, and it must not be tolerated. \n\nWe must be compassionate, I think compassion is the essence of being a leftist. Like you said, you're not going to \"convert\" hardcore zionists. You're not going to convince a person who thinks god gave them the land, that he didn't, and you're not going to convince a person who hates palestinians and doesn't give a shit about their ancestral ties to the land to change their opinion. But calling out the legitimate antisemitic and problematic rhetoric here would do wonders.  I will also say that young jewish progressives feeling protected and welcomed here would be a very positive force for change re: american judaism and zionism. The more jewish people are pro palestinian, the less the \"criticism of israel is inherently antisemitic\" argument will hold weight. Jews know each other. Jews talk to each other. It's imperative that leftist ones can speak for themselves and be protected in leftist circles."

That indigeneity doesn't entitle anyone to institute oppression or political domination over others, but it does make a non-starter any solution that involves ethnic cleansing or the stripping of autonomy from those groups.

I left another comment, you're free to look at it, but in general I think antisemitism ,and actual education about jews and jewish history would help here. Some people consider a one state solution antisemitic. I don't think you can honestly say that with a straight face, BUT I do think that being careful, being well informed and educated on the topic, and calling out problematic things against jews here would go a long way, so that we can acknowledge zionist responses to things like this, and have good responses to them. Some common ones are \"jews have no ancestral ties to the land.\" Yes. Jews do. It's been proven many times through genetic tests.  But Palestinians have a stronger one. Acknowledging the jewish tie to the land doesn't detract from the pro palestinian side,  I honestly think it makes it stronger. There are others but off the top of my head, I can't think of them right now."

Racist? Yes, absolutely, that's self-evident at this point. Colorist? Just ask the Beta Israel who they forcibly sterilized in the past. But when you call them White Supremacist, no matter how pedantic the difference may seem, you make it easier for Zionist voices to delegitimize your arguments to the young Jews (and especially young Israelis) who are among those who most need to hear them"

It was deliberately allowed to go ahead to give Netanyahu a pretext for an invasion of Gaza. Ben Gvir and many other cabinet ministers are screaming for the expulsions of Palestinians and the return of settlers. It was never about Hamas. Its always been about ethnically cleaning Gaza. It wouldn't surprise me if Mosad helped aid the 7th Oct attack. Either through indirectly feeding Hamas intel or planting an agent in Hamas' ranks. The latter though does seem a little more far fetched but not entirely impossible."

We had 7th Oct last year. We had HAMAS firing rockets into Israel after Arab and Jew protests in 2021. The kidnapping and killing of Israeli teenagers in 2014. A rocket barrage from Hamas into Israel from Gaza in 2012. The same thing happened in 2008 at the start of the 'Gaza War'... and it just goes on.\n\nHAMAS has started almost every conflict with the intentions of mass Israeli deaths, which always had the consequence of mass Palestinian deaths. HAMAS is the culprit of Palestinians as much as the IDF is... unfortunately extremist groups in Palestine brainwash those people to pick up arms to fight with HAMAS under positive goals but end up being counter-intuitive and more harmful to their people.\n\nI'm not a general or an expert in geo-politics, so I have absolutely no Idea how this problem can be fixed."

Being uninformed and therefore legitimately thinking all Jewish people are white, and that the majority of the Jews in Israel are from Europe\u2026 white = colonizer = bad.\n\n2. The United States is allied with Israel and gives money to Israel.. it would make sense to give special attention to places we give money to and what they are doing with it, as opposed to calling out other places in the world we aren\u2019t directly funding \n\n3. Limited capacity. Israel is a hot topic right now, and it has been for a while. I\u2019m Jewish and I feel more passionately about the Palestinian people than say, the Uyghurs. I\u2019m not antisemitic.. I just don\u2019t hear about every single thing going on in the world all the time. A lot of people view Israel/Palestine as a representation for all liberation.. a step 1. They don\u2019t want it to be the *only* liberation movement.. they just think dismantling this situation would lead to similar liberation around the world.. and that might be more impactful than dividing up attention sporadically to multiple world causes \n\n4. Lack of awareness of anti Jewish tropes or why things are offensive. If you\u2019re not Jewish, you\u2019re not going to be as sensitive about certain things and may not be able to recognize it\u2026 like something that bothered me a lot was the whole \u201cJesus was a Palestinian\u201d thing around Christmas.. because they never mentioned how he was a Jew.. and it felt a lot like repackaged \u201cJews killed Jesus\u201d. I don\u2019t think most people meant it that way, however\u2026\n\n5. Which leads to my next point. People in lefty spaces are really not willing to listen to \u201cJews\u201d. Maybe they are willing to listen to Jews of color, sometimes.. if they are staunchly anti Israel. But they don\u2019t want to listen to Jewish feelings because they think it\u2019s just Zionist weaponization and/also they don\u2019t think it\u2019s as important as the Palestinian genocide.. which is fair.. but it IS important.. because letting harmful rhetoric slide has lasting impacts. It\u2019s not \u201cok well we\u2019ll address this later when we\u2019ve fixed Palestine\u201d\u2026 if the way you\u2019re talking about the genocide invokes dangerous ideas around Jewish people.. that\u2019s going to last\u2026 and it\u2019s a problem. \n\n6. People not really having foundational knowledge of leftism so they aren\u2019t looking at anything through a values lens.. just passion and emotion.. and therefore, they might not see why it\u2019s silly to be so inconsistent on Jewish people vs Palestinian people vs any other group. Norm finklestien is very smart, so I don\u2019t quite put him in this category.. but even he is super transphobic\u2026 despite everything about him regarding Palestine making me assume he\u2019d be the opposite \n\nI don\u2019t believe in condemning a whole movement as \u201cantisemitic\u201d because of the above points I\u2019ve made. That would be like throwing out all of feminism because of white feminism.. let\u2019s weed out the problematic parts and not throw the baby out with the bath water.. IMO"

What you've stated are well-documented historical facts that anyone could look up if they chose. This is a separate issue from Bibi's govt declaring any criticism of them anti-semitic, and is certainly something that I haven't seen as part of most leftists' good-faith defenses of Palestine freedom and self-determination. But it must be talked about when it appears, because it's real. No good can come from ignoring it or telling Jewish people they are imagining it (gaslighting). Maybe even more bridges could be built towards wide support for the Palestinian cause if these basic facts weren't dismissed outright?"

The guy who's only claim to being an \"expert\" is that he's a Christian, and whose only attempt to cite a source is \"go and read your Bibles\". \n\nListen: study after study has shown that all Jews, even Askenazi Jews have genetic links to the middle east and the land of Israel. It is no longer really up for debate. If you want to see proof of that, you can look at the *hundreds* of posts on r/illustrativedna that show Askenazi Jews with significant ancient Canaanite DNA. but I suspect you won't do that - it would challenge your deep seated bigotry and hatred of Jews. \n\nYou're far dumber than I gave you credit for.

        "libertarian_to_authoritarian_rating": "This thread provides a nuanced discussion on the complexities surrounding criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism/anti-Israeli sentiment. The author shares their personal experiences and observations on social media, highlighting the fine line between legitimate criticism and hate speech. Here are some key points:\n\n1.  **Avoid dehumanizing language**: The author emphasizes the importance of using respectful language when discussing political issues. Avoiding terms like \"genocide supporters\" or \"murderers\" can help maintain a constructive dialogue.\n2.  **Acknowledge diverse perspectives**: Recognize that not all Israelis or Jews support the current government's actions. There are left-wing Israelis and Jewish organizations, such as B'tselem, Breaking the Silence, and Haaretz, that critically evaluate Israeli policies.\n3.  **Be mindful of historical context**: The author mentions the \"From the River to the Sea\" phrase, which has historically been associated with anti-Semitic rhetoric. Be aware of the potential implications of using certain phrases or slogans.\n4.  **Focus on facts and solutions**: Stick to verifiable information and avoid making blanket statements about entire groups. Offering constructive ideas and solutions can help move the conversation forward.\n5.  **Respect individual opinions**: The author notes that people like them, who support Palestinian rights but also acknowledge Hamas's violence, are often labeled as \"genocide supporters\" or \"paid propaganda.\" Respect individuals' right to hold complex views.\n\nThe rating for this post is -2, indicating a lightly libertarian stance. The author advocates for maximum individual freedom and minimizes government interference in personal and economic matters, while still acknowledging the need for some level of control to maintain order and stability.",
        "left_to_right_rating": "This is a long and complex text that appears to be a collection of comments and discussions on social media regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict. Here's a breakdown of the main points:\n\n**Common criticisms of anti-Israel sentiment:**\n\n1. Reducing Israeli opinions to \"Zionist\" or \"hasbara bot\" without considering diverse perspectives within Israel.\n2. Dehumanizing or minimizing the experiences of Israelis, particularly those who are critical of the government.\n3. Using language that is hostile and derogatory towards all Israelis or Jews.\n4. Assuming that anyone with a differing opinion must be paid or controlled by the Israeli government.\n5. Ignoring or dismissing the existence of left-wing groups within Israel, such as B'tselem and Breaking the Silence.\n\n**Examples of problematic language:**\n\n1. Using phrases like \"From the River to the Sea\" without acknowledging its historical connotation.\n2. Downplaying the impact of Hamas and Palestinian terrorism on the conflict.\n3. Minimizing or justifying the actions of Hamas during the recent conflict.\n4. Using language that implies all Israelis are responsible for the government's policies.\n\n**Examples of problematic attitudes:**\n\n1. Assuming that all Israeli hostages are soldiers, and therefore \"fair game\".\n2. Expressing blanket hatred towards all Israelis or Jews.\n3. Ignoring or dismissing the experiences and perspectives of Israelis who are critical of the government.\n\n**General advice:**\n\n1. Stick to facts and avoid dehumanizing or minimizing others' experiences.\n2. Offer solutions that are not ridiculous or extreme.\n3. Avoid reducing others' opinions to \"paid propaganda\" or \"brainwashing\".\n4. Consider diverse perspectives within Israel, including left-wing groups.\n5. Be respectful and open-minded when engaging with others who have differing opinions.\n\nOverall, this text highlights the importance of nuance and respect in online discussions about complex issues like the Israel-Palestine conflict. It encourages readers to approach these topics with an open mind, avoiding simplistic or reductionist language that can lead to misunderstandings and further polarization."

You claim voting for either party will change nothing in regards to the issue you currently find most pressing. Therefore, if there is no progress to be made in that arena, then operating outside of the electoral system to affect change would be the most effective in the short term, correct? Something that is also true is that any direct action is not mutually exclusive with voting. If we consider each party's policy on other issues, they are markedly different, especially when it comes to LGBT rights. One party doesn't want LGBT people to express themselves in public, the other gives support to the LGBT community. As an LGBT person, not only do I want to pick a party that has a realistic chance of winning (otherwise my vote has affected no real change) but I also want to pick a party that supports my best interests.\n\nIn summary, by combining direct action on the things my vote has no impact on, and voting for the things that can be changed by the winning candidate, I can make an impact on the things I find important while still maintaining my self preservation to continue fighting in the long run."

They fought a revolution over it (kinda).\n\nLet me give you another example. I am playing a game called Stellaris. It's a multiplayer, randomized map grand strategy game set in space, and in my case I am playing against AI. I'm in control of Earth's empire. Each empire has different beliefs and policies which go with those beliefs.\n\nThere is something like a UN, and individual empires can form 2 party military alliances or can create federations with multiple members.\n\nI am currently allied with several democratic nations which are \"xenophiles\" meaning that they have positive opinions of other alien species and like to be egalitarian. Those are great matches. Yet i've also currently vasvassalized an empire the game describes as \"ruthless capitalists\", and currently they are helping me combat the only other empire with vassals out there, which the game describes as \"slaving despots\". They started with 3 vassals, but I successfully broke one of them off in a war of independence which I backed, and then I formed a defensive net around them so they could not be reincorporated without war against me and my allies.\n\nThis might be seen as imperialist. Is it evil? I don't think so. When this all started, that rival Meta-empire was a real threat to my Meta-empire (which had policies objectively much kinder to my vassals than the other Meta-empire's policies) and could have started very bad wars with me. They were enslaving a race of pacifist mushroom people (which in this case doesn't preclude wars of independence). Now they are weaker by far and not a threat to democracy in the rest of the galaxy.\n\nCan you see why I would take an imperialist action in this case? I don't mean to ask if you agree. I mean, does this mape sense in light of everything else I have told you about my way of thinking? Is it consistent for me?"

Under British rule, Hong Kong never held a single election and all positions of government were appointed by the governor. China finally got Hong Kong back just in 1997.\n\nThe protests since then have been funded by the US. In August 2019, US diplomat Julie Eadeh was caught meeting HK protest leaders and leaders of Hong Kong\u2019s opposition have spent years cultivating close relationships with US politicians. They have met with Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, Marco Rubio, and Rick Scott, and Tom Cotton.\n\nThe Hong Kong Democracy Council was launched on September 16, 2019, with Joshua Wong and other Hong Kong opposition figures attending the opening reception. The council was formed with the aim of \u201cpushing the US to uphold its commitment to Hong Kong\u2019s basic freedoms and autonomy and to preserve the US\u2019s own political and economic interests in Hong Kong.\u201d The majority of HKDC\u2019s advisory board is made up of members of the National Endowment for Democracy, the Open Society Foundation, the Council on Foreign Relations, and Freedom House. Between 1995 and 2013, The Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor received more than $1.9 million in funds from the NED.\n\nAs for Taiwan, when the PRC was founded in 1949, the Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan after being defeated by the Communists. As the PLA was preparing to liberate Taiwan, the Korean War broke out, giving the US the opportunity to send troops into the Taiwan Straits to prevent the PLA from liberating Taiwan, and supported the Kuomintang. In 1958, China tried to end the U.S. occupation of Taiwan Province but had to retreat when the USA sent its nuclear-armed Seventh Fleet.\n\nEven today, though, the US upholds the One China Policy and doesn't recognize Taiwan as a country, rather a part of China.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/90tmeivu68od1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cc6f4e2fa2011ecc22efc10fd13c4a3f058d176\n\nNow find me a map of Chinese military bases surrounding the US or any other country."

The clamor for military spending cuts was growing. That\u2019s the real reason for our glorious war. Surely you are not naive enough to believe the official reasons offered for this imperialist adventure. Are you? The US ruling class doesn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass about territorial integrity, human rights and international law, when we regularly violate the law, invade other countries, install puppet governments and blatantly violate human rights."

There's even families who share ties which live in the Russo-Ukraine's borders.\n\nThis whole concept of indivisive nation and territory is part of the bourgeois ideology, to create a notion of fixed identity and territory which only serves capital interests.\n\nI'm not saying that Russia is the good guy, on the contrary. They were the ones who escalated the conflict to the point of a full blown war. However I wouldn't sacrifice my whole population just to screw them afterwards, regardless of the outcomes of the war. Capitalists don't care about this, though."

The post appears to be a satirical critique of identity politics and labeling, with some comments discussing gatekeeping and infighting within left-wing ideologies. There is no clear advocacy for government control or individual freedom, but rather a focus on critical thinking and nuanced understanding of complex issues.",
        "left_to_right_rating": "Rating: -3\n\nThe post critiques the tendency of some individuals to unfairly stereotype and label others as \"leftists\" without fully understanding their beliefs or values, which is a characteristic of light left politics. The image and the comments suggest that the author is advocating for critical thinking and empathy in communication, rather than promoting radical social change through communism or socialism (far left). The tone is also more nuanced and skeptical towards simplistic labels and purity tests, which is consistent with light left ideology."
