I also like to try and write short texts and go through them with my teacher - it gives you a chance to think about the genders, declension and get them as right as possible - which you just don't have time to properly consider in a conversational setting while trying to maintain easy communication. I also like to reference the [Czech Handbook](https://prirucka.ujc.cas.cz/) which will give you the full conjugation for verbs and declension for nouns if you are ever not sure. It can seem totally overwhelming but trust and believe that there are patterns and after some time and experience certain correct things will just come out of your mouth without thinking about it - which feels like you've unlocked a magical secret. If you like a drink - it can also be good to just get riproaringly fudged up and chat with weird alcoholics in a dive bar - baptism of fire for sure but a great way to learn fun phrases, slang, and make some truly awful friends :-)"

        "selftext": "Hey, /r/Czechia!\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nI live in Seattle, WA in the US and I'm taking a month off of work to drive around Europe *extremely* soon. I made a post about a month ago and I'm coming back with a somewhat more clear vision of what I want. Which is great because I'm leaving tomorrow, lmao. It's both scary and exciting to not have it very planned and that's the point! I'm just having fun with it, shooting pictures, meeting people, getting lost, exploring abandoned buildings, maybe going snowboarding, or doing alternative sports. \n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Here's a crudely drawn map of my route](https://imgur.com/a/DYOHD)** from Dec 11 2017 to Jan 1 2017, including roughly how long it'll take to go to place to place. **It is unlikely that I will do the full region, but who knows**. I'm landing in Poznan on Dec 11th and busing down to Prague to pick up my rental car on Dec. 12th and hang out in Prague for several days or more. From there it is extremely loose. I intend to drive to Budapest on the 19th and if I wanna just go back to Prague after that, I'll do that. If I feel like being an insane person then I might end up driving upwards of 30 hours to wherever! After all of those shenanigans I'm returning the car to Prague and flying to Amsterdam/Cologne for a week or so.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nA little more about me! I'm an artist for a videogame called Guild Wars 2 and love all facets of visual media. I picked up photography about 5 months ago and have been addicted! I'm excited about experiencing as many perspectives as I can. I know I'm not giving myself a whole lot of time to stay in one place for too long, but I can always come back. In a perfect world I'd like to travel to every country on the planet. Or end up being found face down in the snow dead while trying! Haha. * ahem *\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. What spots in this general region would be good for photography? I like shooting anything I can-- landscapes, abandoned places, portraits, animals, or whatever weird shit that comes to mind. I am not big on spots that are crawling with tourists and don't want to take pictures of things everyone else has a zillion times. Off the beaten path is exciting to me, which is why I have the car.\n2. I have no plans for Christmas. Where should I go?\n3. I have no plans for New Year's. Where should I go?\n4.Does anyone want to grab a drink or something while I'm on this trip? ",
